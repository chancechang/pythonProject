6.0 / 10,"Liam Neeson played by Liam Neeson. You've seen it before. But, it's still entertaining.",MickandRorty,12 January 2018,"There are certain actors in Hollywood that are so one-dimensional, but they play that one-dimension spot on. Liam Neeson is one of those guys. Another example is Jason Statham. Their roles are all the same, scripts slightly tweaked, yet the movie passes of as decent-to-good almost every time (except for the Taken sequels, but that isn't on Liam).Bottom line is, it's basically the movie non-stop, but on a commute instead of a plane. Liam Neeson plasy his same old self and plays his usual one-dimensional badass role. He did his job once again. This movie will bring in okay-enough numbers, and we will be presented with Liam Neeson's next challenge in about another year.Same old, decent-enough action movie.6/10"
7.0 / 10,"""Non Stop"" on rails: thoroughly familiar yet thoroughly enjoyable",Paul Allaer,12 January 2018,"""The Commuter"" (2018 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Michael McCauley. As the movie opens, we get to know Micheal as he goes about his daily routine of waking up at 6 am and getting ready to take the commuter train in Manhattan, where he works at an insurance company. Then one day, out of the blue, Michael is fired from his job, for no apparent reason and just as he needs the money to pay for his son's expensive college. Afterwards he commiserates with a buddy (and that's when we find out Michael used to be a NYC cop). On his commute train ride home, Michael gets approached by a mysterious woman who makes him an offer: identify the person who doesn't belong on the train, and get $100,000 in return. She tells him there is a $25,000 upfront payment in the bathroom. When Michael goes to check there, he can't believe it but yes, there's the money. He decides to take it. It's not long before strange things start to happen... At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is, if I'm counting right, the 4th collaboration between Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra and lead actor Liam Neeson, after ""Unknown"", ""Non Stop"", and ""Run All Night"". (Collet-Serra also directed the excellent shark-drama ""The Shallows"".) Just looking at these prior films, you know EXACTLY what you are signing up for if you decide to check out ""The Commuter"". In fact, this movie could be called ""Non Stop on Rails"". Just like that earlier movie playing out on the one air flight, much of ""The Commuter"" plays out on the one commuter train ride back to suburban NYC. If this sounds like like a negative, you might be wrong, as I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out what the heck was going on (in the best possible way). One-time 'serious' actor Liam Neeson's transformation into one of the best and most reliable action movie stars is absolutely remarkable. He brings a certain weight and charisma into these roles that not a lot of action movie stars have. Keep an eye out for an all-too-rare sighting of Elizabeth McGovern (as Neeson'swife). Sam Neil has a small role as the Police Captain. Vera Farmiga is her usual great in the small role of the mysterious woman. But in the end, this is of course the Liam Neeson show all the way. ""The Commuter"" opened wide this weekend. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended very well, and surely the inclement weather here in Cincinnati was a large factor in that. I was in the mood for something to entertain me, and ""The Commuter"" was just what the doctor ordered: thoroughly familiar, yet thoroughly enjoyable too. If you are a fan of Liam Neeson's action movies, you cannot go wrong with this one. ""The Commuter"" is a WINNER."
8.0 / 10,"Fun movie, worth seeing on a big screen with big sound",Dan Phillips,12 January 2018,"Neeson creates a likable, sympathetic character. This is necessary for the heightening of tension, which screws on inexorably until you just don't see any way out for him.The camera-work was particularly masterful - creative, meticulous, thought out to a granular level. There are two particular action-pieces towards the climax that are breathtaking, at least one of which looks like (but surely isn't) a single, extended take. The camera defines space and gravity, and is part of the expeience.Yes, there are some credibility straining factors. But it is after all a movie, not a procedural. On the other hand, there are some very neat surprises.Glad we saw it!"

7.0 / 10,great action movie,Beth DeMatteo,14 January 2018,"Like the movie, usually like anything he is in. It was fast paced and kept you thinking but it always annoys the **** out of me when the staff does not do their homework on a movie. I always love places where they show errors that are not picked up in scenes before the movie is finally printed. My gripe here was the ending where the standoff occurred in Beacon NY with NYPD police in charge. Did noone tell them that NYPD has no standing in that area? Where were the NY state troopers?? Just knitpicking I realize but that is someone's job.."
7.0 / 10,This is what you get when amateur writers think they can write a screenplay,Harrison Tweed (Top Dawg),12 February 2018,"The directing was decent, the acting was great, the cinematography on point but the writing and screenplay by both amateurs Philip de Blasi and Byron Willinger is what ruined this movie. There were more plot holes and ridiculous scenarios (and lack of logical ones) than there were commuters on the full train at the start. How difficult is it with such a big budget and top notch Hollywood backers to allow such garbage writing ruin what could have been a great film. Too bad, not even Liam Neeson could save this one. A generous 7/10 from me"
7.0 / 10,"Nothing new from Neeson, in a good way (and a bad way).",liamhorsfall,13 January 2018,"If you've seen one Neeson film, you've probably seen them all. Despite having already mastered the art of playing the grizzled, independant tough-guy, Neeson is back with The Commuter, in which he plays an unsuspecting ... well ... commuter, who is drawn into a criminal conspiracy which could kill everyone on-board.It's a familiar sounding plot, but it's one that Neeson excels in, in fact, he may be too good at it by now. With all that said, The Commuter, much like Taken, Taken 2, Taken 3, Non-Stop, A Walk Among the Tombstones, Run All Night and Schindlers List, is another fun Neeson film which you'll probably enjoy much more than you'd be willing to admit."
7.0 / 10,Strangers on a Train,rbrb,11 January 2018,"This is a decent action-thriller movie.A long time train commuter is surprised by a stranger on a train with an enticing offer; after a bad day at the office the commuter is dragged into an ever spiraling dangerous ride.There is danger, suspense and intrigue.Ok so parts of the story may be far fetched but all the players give first rate convincing performances and aided by a distinct feel of realism during the train journey, these factors convinces me the movie deserves a solid:7/10."
3.0 / 10,"""This train is freaking me out"".",bob-the-movie-man,20 January 2018,"""The Commuter"" is not a good film. You know that I'm not a prude about action films: ""Die Hard"" is one of my all time favourites and I even gave this actor/director combo's previous outing - ""Non-Stop"" - a rather generous three Fads. But like many of my commutes, this is a hundred minutes of life that I won't get back again.Liam Neeson (""A Monster Calls"", ""Taken 3"") plays Michael MacCauley an insurance salesman (no, I'm not making it up) who of course used to be a police officer with a certain set of skills. With advancing years, a couple of mortgages to keep up and a son about to go to college, he is financially rather exposed.When a bad day turns worse, the commuting MacCauley is approached by a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga, ""The Judge"", ""Up In The Air"") who offers him a financial bail-out for doing ""just one small thing"". No, it's not for sex in the toilet... it's to use his familiarity with the train and its normal passengers to find the person that 'doesn't fit there'. For there is a lot at stake and MacCauley is drawn into a perilous game where his own life and the lives of his son and wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern, ""Downton Abbey"") are put at risk. What the inexperienced writers (Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle (""Non-stop"")) were clearly shooting for was a Hitchcockian ""ordinary man in deep-water"" style flick of the James Stewart ""North by Northwest"" variety.... but they really miss this by a mile. With the 65 year old Liam Neeson - here playing 60 - performing acrobatics on, under and across an express train, belief is not just suspended - it is hung drawn and quartered! The action is just ludicrously unrealistic. The plot also has more holes than a moth-eaten jumper. Omnipotence of the villains is evident, but never explained, and while they are fiendishly clever in some aspects they are face-palmingly stupid about others. (No spoilers, but the threat to MacCauley's family is mind-numbingly foilable).A 'major event' at the end of reel two (if you've seen the spoilerish trailer you'll know what this is) leads - notably without any 'consequence' - into a completely ridiculous final reel that beggars belief. It also includes a ""twist"" so obvious that the writers must have assumed an IQ of sub-50.This is a film that melds ""Taken"", ""Non-stop"", ""Unstoppable"", ""Strangers on a Train"" and - most bizarrely and cringe-worthily - ""Spartacus"" to create a cinematic mess of supreme proportions. I put director Jaume Collet-Serra's last film - ""The Shallows"" - into my Top 10 films of 2016. He'll be lucky if this one doesn't make my ""Turkeys of the Year"" list for 2018.Avoid!"
6.0 / 10,Decent Thriller Derailed by Ridiculous Third Act,Fletcher Conner,15 January 2018,"The Commuter delivers what it promises, a Liam Neeson action movie that relies on tension and a little bit of mystery to fill out its runtime. It begins very well with minimal exposition for the set up, using images or short conversations to explain what most movies would carve out five minutes of dialogue for. From there it evolves more like a mystery with an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation searching for someone on the train. As it enters the third act, it goes full action movie with explosions, fight scenes, and massive stakes. While this was to be expected from Jaume Collet-Serra, it undermines what had been a more contained thriller up to that point.It is shot well enough and uses an ensemble cast well, but no one besides Liam Neeson really has too much to do. Vera Farmiga and Jonathan Banks are both talented actors that are really underutilized. All in all, The Commuter is another Liam Neeson action movie that could be best described as ""Nonstop on a train."""
7.0 / 10,"Part Hitchcockian whodunnit and part white-knuckle thrills, 'The Commuter' overcomes what it lacks in logic with well-executed suspense and action",moviexclusive,10 January 2018,"Hard to believe that it has been 10 years since Liam Neeson became an unexpected action star with the lean, spare but brutally effective thriller 'Taken', and in the decade that's passed cemented his late renaissance with well-executed B-movie fare like 'The A-Team', 'The Grey', 'Unknown', 'Non-Stop' and 'Run All Night'. The last three were also notable for being collaborations with director Jaume Collet-Serra, and the now 65-year-old has extended their team-up with 'The Commuter', which sees Serra further lay claim to a modern-day Alfred Hitchcock with a couple of high-wire scenes that would certainly make the latter proud.As with before, there is a high-concept scenario at the heart of this deliberately old-fashioned thriller: an everyday insurance salesman Michael McCauley (Neeson) finds his routine evening commute back home from work disrupted by the enigmatic stranger Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who sits opposite him on the Metro-North train and offers him a hefty financial reward if he is able to spot someone on the train who isn't a familiar face. In order for Michael to be tempted in the first place, first-time screenwriters Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi set him up to lose his job on that same day, leaving him floundering over his two mortgages as well as tuition fees for his college-bound son - although because this is Neeson we're talking about, you know Michael will eventually do the right, honorable and even heroic thing.To up the ante, Michael is only given slightly more than half an hour before the train reaches Cold Spring to find the individual he is told later on goes by the name of Prynne; and to raise the stakes, it turns out that Joanna has also held his wife and son hostage, both of whom she threatens to kill if Michael fails to complete his mission. True to his Hitchcockian ambition, Serra spins an intriguing web of mystery over most of the middle act, and there are at least three riveting questions that are teased. Who is Prynne? Who is Joanna and/or the people she is working with or for? And finally, what does Joanna want with Prynne? These in turn translate into solid character work for the proverbial strangers on the train whom Michael probes to locate his mark - among them a feisty college student (Florence Pugh), an arrogant Wall Street banker (Shazad Latif), an emotionally distraught nurse (Clara Lago), a tattooed bruiser (Roland Moller) and a taciturn teenager (Ella-Rae Smith).Yet Serra is all too aware that a whodunnit in and of itself is unlikely to satiate a good proportion of his audience, who are here to watch Neeson engage in the sort of close-quarter fisticuffs a la 'Taken'. So in between playing detective, Michael also gets a couple of well-choregraphed brawls - one of them takes place in the confines between carriages, while another that is impressively done in a single take plays out over an entire carriage with everything from a gun, an ax, a guitar and seat cushions used as weapons. There is visibly concerted effort to keep these fight sequences real, so even though Neeson's character is revealed earlier on to be an ex-cop, the film doesn't (thankfully) use that as an excuse to gift him with ""a very particular set of skills"" to take down his opponents too easily, skilfully or neatly.Like other locomotive-set thrillers, this one doesn't escape without the train in question going out of control and then literally off the rails. That it is well-staged is undeniable - not even some subpar CGI in some shots can detract from the sheer white-knuckle tension of seeing almost the whole train flip into the air - but this spectacle-fuelled conclusion arguably strains the credibility of the high-concept movie even further, and is therefore both better and worse off for it. Notwithstanding, Neeson remains through and through the film's emotional centre, conveying the frustration, helplessness and resolve of a regular guy who is trying to get his life back in control from those that have snatched it away from him. Lest we forget, this is a role that the thespian can easily do in his sleep, but Neeson still brings his considerable gravitas to bear.Mind you, not all the gaps in the narrative will be filled in by the end (which seems to set up the possibility of a sequel) nor will some of the explanations pass muster under closer scrutiny. Still, a film like this isn't meant to be held up under such examination or intended to offer any more than solid B-movie guilty pleasures; on the latter count though, it does succeed brilliantly and beautifully by mixing classic Hitchcockian tension with adrenaline-pumping action. We dare say that it ranks among one of Neeson's best in his action oeuvre, and if you're in the mood for some pulpy thrills and suspense, then you'll definitely want to get on this train."
4.0 / 10,Partly quite good and partly extremely bad...,EskeRahn,10 January 2018,"Basically a good plot, good acting, a good bit of suspense, action and good effects, so how can this go wrong?Well parts of it is so ridiculous and stupid that it is hard to believe no one stopped it at the script level.. And parts are just 'over the top', sort of ""OK we have paid for effects, so now give us a truck load full"" - I was VERY close to leaving the theatre a couple of times....And this is really sad, as it could have been a good action thriller, as the ideas were good.I believe that cutting away the bad stuff that sums up to less than half an hour and replace a few minutes, and it could have been great in the genre!"

5.0 / 10,One Stop Ride,Thomas Drufke,15 January 2018,"I enjoy Liam Neeson action flicks as much as the next guy, but I also prefer say a Taken, The Grey, or Unknown over such films as Taken 2 or 3. In other words, it's as simple as saying I enjoy his action outings when they are a nice mix of fun thrills with serious overtones. To me, that's when he succeeds the most. The Commuter, which is supposedly his last action film, is a less than stellar film that revolves around another unbelievably silly (but plausible for a Neeson film) situation in which the 65 year old action star can flex his abilities.The problem I had with The Commuter was that it lacks the fun that some of Neeson's previous outings had. In large part, it mirrors another train thriller from a few months ago, Murder on the Orient Express. The mystery has some interesting twists and turns, but there just isn't enough action pizazz to keep it from being forgettable within days. In fact, I saw the movie yesterday, and I'm having some trouble remembering certain plot elements.There are some solid performances among some not so good ones. Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Sam Neil, and Jonathan Banks do their best with a serviceable script to provide intriguing characters and plot developments that are nothing more than B-movie material. I guess that's probably the best way to describe this film, it's something that you could enjoy on a night home and scrolling through channel guide. But there's nothing nuanced or special about The Commuter. It's the prototypical January release.5.2/10"
9.0 / 10,Get on the train for THIS movie!,melliemulch867,15 January 2018,"I'm not a gifted movie reviewer like many on here (LOL), but I can tell you that my husband and I really enjoyed this movie! It's fantastic! Plenty of action and twists and turns. Great acting job by the cast and fantastic directing. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and grabbing my husband's hand. If you like suspense/action movies then you'll love this movie!"
7.0 / 10,Better than expected,nahas-marwan-453-338903,14 January 2018,"The movies is a suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Nothing very new or original, yet liam neeson sticks to his tried and tested formula which actually works. It's a fun movies don't over think it and you will enjoy."
8.0 / 10,A satisfactory thriller with a few distractions..........,kashidomar,10 January 2018,The movie is quite a good movie and i really think movie lovers should go at it . It is a thrill spiced movie with many suspenses and hidden turns in the story . The movie flows around a commuter train and builds all the potential actions and dramas around it. Nice to see Liam Neeson in the central role . He has done extremely well and he has delivered these stuffs to us for many times. Actions are pretty new and mindblowing. Action lovers will like it certainly. The only draw back is the monotonous story but the pace of actions and suspenses has overcome it at last . So my opinion is 8/10.

3.0 / 10,This was a stupid movie,zsiga-53201,26 January 2018,"Being a big Liam Neeson fan took the girl to watch this in the theater on big screen wow the action scenes will look awesome! .. well sort of. The script is so stupid and contorted that even Neeson and Vera Farmiga's legs can't save it. Our hero is old and tired, trapped on a train, just got fired so desperate for the money, his adversaries know everything, can tap into phones, can kill everyone but they need to play this game with the hero. What a bs.I'm really surprised why Neeson took the contract he shouldn't go down the same path with Bruce Willis playing in B- movies. It was like watching a mild version of Steven Segal: Under Siege 2 without the action scenes."
8.0 / 10,Non Stop 2 -The Commuter,garytruffitt,6 February 2018,"If you enjoy Liam Neesan movies you should enjoy this. It's basically the movie Non Stop, but instead of a plane it's a train. Not much else to add other then I really enjoyed this movie"
8.0 / 10,"If you like Non Stop, you'll love this.",garytruffitt,6 February 2018,"I went to the cinema expecting to see a movie similar to Non Stop, and guess what. I was right. To be fair I don't know why they didnt just call this Non Stop 2 - The Commuter. That does not stop this from being a very good movie though. Neesan is at his very best in these sort of movies and it's no different here. The film has a very good cast and the pacing of the movie is near perfect. The only real negative is a scene which takes place later on in the film, Which lets it down a little, But other wise this is a very good movie."
3.0 / 10,Scrambled Mess,rioplaydrum,24 January 2018,"Fifteen minutes in and I had no idea what was going. Seriously.Convoluted plot, impossible dialog, very cliché CGI effects.Too many details and highly unlikely developments that over-pack a story which intends to impress and only achieves the opposite.The 'Mystery Woman' really got on my nerves. Her disembodied ubiquitous presence pops in and out on smartphones through out the train ride just to let you know she sees and hears all every second of the day and night.Right.Shortest review I've ever written.Pointless and unredeemable."
5.0 / 10,"Passable action flick, plenty of style but little substance",areatw,23 January 2018,"'The Commuter' is a stylish, well produced action movie but, as with many other films in this genre, it has a plot that fails to stand up to scrutiny. Far-fetched would be an understatement - it all feels very 'make it up as you go along', with no explanation given for much of what takes place on the train and an underwhelming ending that leaves more questions than answers.Plot aside, 'The Commuter' is a decent piece of entertainment, thanks largely to the high production value and Liam Neeson's compelling performance as the lead character. If you can zone out of the story and enjoy the fights, explosions and everything else that comes with a Liam Neeson action movie, then 'The Commuter' is a passable action flick, but nothing that hasn't already been done before."
5.0 / 10,See Only If You Like Stupid Conspiracy Crime Movies With Liam Neeson,AudioFileZ,21 January 2018,"If you're going to roll out Liam Neeson once more as the everyman terminator I guess you'll get a certain built-in audience which seems proven. What's the setup this time? Ahh, a aged man suddenly in a particularly vunerable state fighting for his family's safety usually makes one...check. Badguys who give you a mission you must complete to save your family to which you aren't sure who the badguys actually are...check. And everything important occurs on a train. Ahem, that's a blend of something akin to Hitchcock meets a bit of action. This could be interesting if the story line is perhaps?The Commuter takes a spotty murderous game and seeks to throw in enough reality with mysterious complications forgetting to question how ridiculous the actual game is. Since the baddies seem to know enough to assinate their target we're suppose to believe they need to preposturously manipulate Neeson's character instead. But why? The whole idea seems needlessly contrived.After watching the film I felt like the only reason I watched was to make more sense of something so wrong. Neeson plays the role with the right degree of desparation alright as he seems like a doomed ping-pong ball in his search for his target. He seems both on the edge as well as determined, with little chance of success. Of course we already know we must have him not fail and that waters an already confusing silly story.If Liam Neeson couldn't play this role so well this film would be, well, needless in most every regard. Admittedly there is something to seeing him constantly being a hair from disaster yet hanging on that is compelling. It doesn't really make any sense however and the ending feels totally as an ""Hail Mary"" attempt to tidy it all up. I really can't recommend it as sush."
5.0 / 10,Dead title dead storyline felt rushed and unbelievable,Bajyohface,21 January 2018,"They tried to do too much and it didnt work, not believable enough like taken unknown run all night non stop. Neeson is playing an old man in the movie. We don't realise but hes actually quite old for an action hero.
Its like they took good scenes from different movies and put it all together...Mixed it up...blended it...added liam neeson...overpromoted it and voila u got a dead movie. And im a neeson fan! Its got the same directors as non stop and run all night which were enjoyable movies. Although even in non stop, the last 20 minutes was rushed and solved too quickly and unbelievably. Sorry Liam. U r still the man but just not in this mpvie. I hate it when good actors do dry movies getting washed up in the process. Like Bruce willis"
6.0 / 10,Derails off the tracks,Corey James,19 January 2018,"This review of The Commuter is spoiler free*** (3/5)LIAM NEESON COMES with baggage, that's inevitable after years of being caught in action thrillers that have both earned him a spotty track record but it's also given him a particular set of skills, these he can use to pull punches, kick a few people and even pull out a gun or two. Granted this may lead you to quote that infamous line from the first Taken - go ahead then, but it also means that he's never really boring even though some of his movies certainly are. 
 
Though his track record isn't all bad or all boring as he has, on occasion between franchises stepped over a few high peaks (The Grey, A Walk Among the Tombstones are worth the mention), but also in that time he's also stepped into a puddle of deep, deep mud (Battleship, Taken 2 and 3) and often it seemed that he would never really get away from that plot. So, yes this particular set of skills can get him out of some heavy sh*t, but sometimes that can be hard to get out of if indeed it's anything like Battleship. Still, he manages to stay entertaining and it's his many collaborations with director Jaume Collet-Serra that make him an entertaining asset to action. Firstly, Unknown (nobody knew him), next Non-Stop (he killed on a plane), and lastly in Run All Night (he saves his family from danger). However their fourth time as a duo The Commuter is indeed their best yet. Plot-wise it's like it is the sequel to Non-Stop, however his acting chops carry the film and he proves that he can play his way around some Hitchcockian twists. 
 
Here he has to chase a stranger on a train, in an effort to get information and the hitch is that he has to do it while on the train. Granted the plotting doesn't make much sense and the logic bomb detonates before the train leaves the station, but it's the dedication of Collet-Serra to work in small spaces and Neeson's will to raise the tension while finding this person. Also the murder mystery plotting sounds like an Agatha Christie adaptation, and sure in small doses it can be, though the train isn't as lavish as The Orient Express also the supporting players are nothing like that. Still what there is on offer for the supporters is another team-up with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson except here they don't share any screen time together. In short, The Commuter isn't exactly a thoughtful thriller thanks to the workmanlike scripting but it is surprisingly entertaining and that is worth the watch.VERDICT Neeson is thrilling to watch in this surprisingly enjoyable if a little forgettable crowd-pleaser that takes you on a thrill ride - in more than just one way."
5.0 / 10,Just a one way ticket please,Grumphy,18 January 2018,"The CommuterStory is a bit. Well. What do you expect? It's a full on action flick. Though it has some redeeming moments, a few clever twists or turns can't save it from the banality that it promises (and delivers). To clarify, there are more not-quite-so-clever twists. Acting is okay. Though as of late, Liam seems to be doing mostly more action oriented projects for some reason, he has skills that he's acquired over a decently long career and know how to use them. Even if he has to play roles as inane as principled ex cop with money troubles on a train. His co stars, or co passengers, pull something around their own weight. They play their parts as they are, they're not really playing characters, with little time (or need) for development. The jerk is a jerk, the teenage girl is a teenage girl, the random friend is a random friend etc. Visually the film is laughable at times. It's not Scorpion King level bad, but the CGI is terrible. On the plus side, those moments add to fun. I guess. Also the camerawork tends to go overboard for no reason other than... I don't know. It looks cool? It might've if they wouldn't have mixed it with bad CGI. These sort of things tends to happen when you've got nothing to show. Fight screens are decent(ish).Sound or music wise I'm trying to remember if there is anything to comment. I can't think of anything so I'm putting it on the plus side. Emotions and atmosphere seem written, not to say forced. The director Jaume Collet-Serra was either offered a lot of money to do this or he is also very principled and does not negotiate with terrorists. He should, however, make an exception and try to negotiate with the producers, because this could've been a totally different kind of film. But everybody likes fireworks I guess. Even if they don't mean anything. Because they mostly don't. So you forget them soon after."

6.0 / 10,"Nothing really new for Neeson, but still kinda fun",bigfatmouth-23883,16 January 2018,"I admit that Neeson's films are a bit formulaic, but it can still be a fun time to while away some time. He certainly doesn't break any new ground and his nemesis doesn't break much ground, either.Perhaps someone can clear something up for me regarding normal MTA -vs- commuter rail. Is it safe to assume that a commuter rail train leaving Penn Station would not be stopping at MTA stops in Manhattan? I'm not even from NYC, but I was fairly certain commuter rail lines wouldn't have their first stop until they were at least out of Manhattan. That really bugged me in this move."

Yes you have to NOT question parts of the logic (Liam Neeson working in an office selling life insurance...no way) but that is part of the fun of watching this film.The plot was very good and had some surprises in it even though most of the situations have been seen before. The sound and cinematography were excellent. Here I will sum up ""The Commuter"" for you: slow meaningful start, fun thrills in the middle, and a wild over the top ending. What fun!Go see ""The Commuter"", I promise you will not get ""Taken""! TheTruthDoor never lies!"
7.0 / 10,decent entartainment for a plot fitting the lead actor,antoniotierno,15 January 2018,"The story puts Liam Neeson through his violent paces for a fourth time, swapping out Non-Stop's plane for a commuter train and tossing in some financial anxiety for motivation. It's funny in a way, but packed with a lot of adrenaline and action scenes. The mystery is less a whodunit than a whogotit, the ""it"" being a bag containing something stolen that the owner is desperate to recover. If you don't think too hard about why Neeson gets brought in or how the baddies operate or what the point is, you may be able to enjoy it. At least until the final act, when the film goes off the rails. Overall the plot's unlikelihood is really excessive but acting is good, as usual when Neeson is involved."
7.0 / 10,Better than I expected!,Gavin Purtell,15 January 2018,"'The Commuter' is the 4th film directed by Collet-Serra starring Liam Neeson - and it's better than 'Non-Stop' (the one on a plane), but not quite as good as 'Unknown' (the amnesia one). Neeson is struggling to pull off looking even 60 (dyed hair doesn't hide it), but luckily there isn't as many stunts as 'Taken' here. Michael (Neeson) is an ex-cop who now sells life insurance - why'd he leave the force? Don't know. He does, however, commute into New York City via train every day.The first 30min is quite slow & scene setting (Wilson as his ex-partner, Neill as police captain, Banks as fellow train-buddy), before Joanna (Farmiga) sets a mystery in motion that slowly reveals itself. The film slowly picks up pace as more clues are revealed and the body count slowly, but almost plausibly rises (six in total, I think). There's a stand-off at the end, but it's still all over in 100min.I think because my expectations were so low, I enjoyed this more than I might otherwise have. The tension is built quite well, the score's good, the fight scenes are (mostly) realistic and the story, while far-fetched, is not totally unbelievable - some of the stunts are, but that's to be expected. Certainly nothing new or revolutionary, but an enjoyable action/thriller that doesn't outstay it's welcome."

7.0 / 10,Liam Neeson is greater than,Jon Ochiai,14 January 2018,"Liam Neeson elevates ""The Commuter"". Again, Neeson is way better than the material of the movie. Paradoxically, Director Jaume Collet-Serra's ""The Commuter"" poses as an action movie, but is really more thriller that contains action in the narrative genre. The screenplay by Byron Willinger, Philip de Balsi and Ryan Engle is very slow going from the exposition of the set up. Too bad. ""The Commuter"" opens with the provocative premise. Mysterious beautiful Vera Farmiga's Joanna asks commuter train passenger Michael, played by Neeson, ""What kind of person are you?"" Michael we learn from the introduction and series of flashbacks is an Insurance Agent for a large firm in New York City. He is laid off from his job after 10 years of service. This could not have happened at a more inopportune time. Michael and his wife Karen, caring Elizabeth McGovern, are strapped financially having to take out 2 mortgages on their home to send son Danny, played by Dean-Charles Chapman, to Syracuse University in the fall. Michael is a good man. He was an NYPD Officer before retiring to work insurance. Patrick Wilson plays Alex, Michael's dear friend and former Police partner. Too bad McGovern isn't leveraged more here. It is nice seeing her again in movies. After his layoff notice and riding the Commuter train home, Michael sits with Joanna, who offers him $100K if he agrees to determine what passenger on this train doesn't belong. This is more than hypothetical inquiry. What kind of person is Michael? Well, we kind of know through Neeson's persona that he is the noble Hero. Too bad also, charismatic Farmiga is relegated to her voice on mobile phone calls as Michael seeks to solve this puzzle, and save the lives of both Karen and Danny. Neeson is strong as the Michael desperately uses his will, wits, and action skills to save his family in the structured web of lies and betrayal. The ""idiot plot"" is that Joanna should know better than to f with Michael. After all he is Liam Neeson. To that point ""The Commuter"" almost drags and tests your patience waiting for Neeson to unleash upon the villains. Almost. Neeson does deliver with both physical fury and gravitas. Again, he is way better than ""The Commuter"" itself. Unfortunately, having created an intriguing premise into human nature the movie forgets that morphing into a chase and discover narrative-kind of ordinary. Collet-Serra and his writers could have been more ambitious. Liam Neeson deserved better. In a sense so do we. ""The Commuter"" is good mostly, because of Neeson. However, even our Hero can only do so much. This is not a great movie. Yet, it is entertaining. This may have been greater with a little more care and intention."
7.0 / 10,Entertaining...,andrea_m_rodriquez,14 January 2018,"If you enjoyed the ""Taken"" movies, you should enjoy this one. Starts pretty slow, but picks up the pace 20-30 minutes into the movie. It was a good movie, forgettable and typical, but good. Worth a watch at least once."
7.0 / 10,Riding the Train To Mystery and Drama,rgkarim,13 January 2018,"
 Liam Neeson, a legend among the action/dram genre ever since Taken premiered years ago. Despite his best attempts, Neeson cannot seem to escape his typical role, and you know what... fans don't really seem to care. Fortunately, there has been some time lapse since his last escapade, but this weekend he is back in yet another intense movie called The Commuter. Looking to reprise his role once more, can this film triumph, or will it be just another copycat to be lost to the weekend. Robbie K is back with another review and also always thank you for reading. Let's go!LIKES:Mystery: A good mystery always suckers me into a movie and the Commuter has a hum dinger of one to solve. Upon entering the train and meeting Vera Farmiga, Neeson's character is dropped into the mystery with clues abound to choose from. One will have to pay strong attention to the details and dialogue to figure out all the answers, especially with many curve balls thrown in to try and lead you astray. That grand question of who done it, is the focal point of this entire movie, and the key factor to keeping you hooked in the movie. The Suspense: Of course a mystery can only go so far to keeping your interest. The Commuter has your back again on this, by keeping suspense intertwined with the mystery. Primarily through the pace, the Commuter moves at a fast pace to get you to the answers, taking only a few pit stops along the way to introduce a new dynamic into the mix. For once, I can't say there were any major scenes not needed, and with this storytelling, the intensity only deepened. Then come the actual threats and obstacles that further enrich the story, providing a little more depth to the usual plot that builds the intensity of the case, and keeping things relevant to the story. Add the finishing touches of dynamic cinematography with major sound editing and you've got yourself the successful recipe of another drama. The Climax: With all the epic build up promised in this movie, one only hopes the climax is able to meet the demands of the film. Fortunately, this film did not fail to please me with the ending at hand. Keeping with the energy of the film, the finale amped up the intensity with action, emotion, and a few twists to finally answer all the questions at hand. While there was a little convenient moment, the ending manages to bring everything together and leave you feeling fulfilled with true closure and what we can hope leaves no grounds for a sequel. DISLIKES:The Opening: While the Commuter gets to the suspense quickly, I can't say I enjoyed the rushed opening the film started with. A rushed montage that gave you brief glimpses into the life of Neeson's character clearly spell his life out, perhaps going a little too detailed in all aspects of his life. Ironically this approach left me a little bored and cheated of meaningful relationships with his family, you know the motivation for solving the crime, leaving me feeling he was the only one invested in the relationship. They even failed to show his family being kidnapped, and depriving of us the full emotional scale that we got with Taken. I do appreciate trying to get to the goods as soon as possible, but one must make sure to give that character some depth before testing them. Trailer Syndrome: Sadly, The Commuter suffers from the trailers giving a majority of the story away. While not all secrets are revealed, enough twists are shown in the brief 3 minute promotions to help you piece the movie together before it's even started. As if that weren't bad enough, one also can see those obstacles coming a mile away, making the movie become a bit more predictable and less intense. As it is the suspense and mystery that are key to getting the most out of this movie. If you avoid the trailers or are able to drop it out of their minds, no worries, but if you remember these like I do...get ready to be very familiar with these scenes. Semi-Rushed suspects: In movies like clue, and the original murder on the orient express, one become quite engaged in the stories of the those under suspect. However, The Commuter's cast are only semi-expanded upon in this movie and often in misbalanced proportions. Based on how often a character is used can certainly give you hints to their involvement, but these secondary characters are not well-integrated into the movie at times outside of some comedic relief. Sure, you get enough of their story to piece their struggles, but there was much more to be had. The VERDICT: The Commuter is a movie that I quite enjoyed, and is a welcome opening to what will most likely be more Neeson led dramas in the future. A strong mystery ties the action, suspense, and drama into a neat little package that builds up in intensity until the exciting climax emerges to wrap things up. Sadly, there are some editing tactics and semi-rushed development choices that take away from the character Neeson plays. Why they won't expand on his character and give him more depth I can't answer, but it would have been a plus if they had given him a little more to work with so he wouldn't be just another Taken knock off. Still, so long as you avoid the trailers, this movie is worth a trip to the local theater to entertain and tease your brain. My scores are: Action/Crime/Drama: 7.5 
Movie Overall: 6.5LIKES:--Mystery
--Suspense
--ClimaxDISLIKES:--The Opening
--Trailer Syndrome
--Semi-Rushed Suspects. The Commuter succeeds in providing you your Liam Neeson film fix for the next few months. While not an entirely remake of Taken, this film certainly has many similarities that take away from the uniqueness, but will please you. It has suspense and mystery to sweeten the pot, entangle with enough dramatic obstructions to try to deter him from uncovering the truth. Throughout the movie, one will certainly feel the intensity of the movie building, which is answered in spades by the incredible climax. Things will come full circle by the end of the film and the excitement will continue until near the last 10 minutes of the movie, which is something I can get on board with. 
 Sadly, this fast paced approach led to a b perhaps semi-rushed montage that added little to the film outside of quickly establishing his baseline. In addition, this approach crafted Neeson's character to be a bit shallower and boring in his quest to find the answers left bin that era. But when not concerned with the opening, the semi-rushed suspects and trailer syndrome will let you down and ruin many surprises that his movie needs to keep engaging. So bottom line for this is to avoid watching trailers for like the next two months. 
 Despite these areas of improvement though, The Commuter accomplishes it's goals and awaits further viewing by the public. I would recommend seeing this one due to all the mystery/music that graces it. If you decide to wait, please check out RedBox asap to enjoy this movie. My scores are:

8.0 / 10,Typical Liam Neeson movie!,allankaaber,15 January 2018,"Great action/suspense thriller with Liam Neeson. So if you like movies like Taken and Non-Stop, you should definitely watch this one.
You Will be sitting on the edge of your seat, while trying to guess what is going on and who are the people on the train. 
Liam is badass as ALWAYS! 
I was surprised to see danish actor Roland M03ller (under sandet) in this movie too.. He is onde of our best actors, and it's nice to see, that he has taken on the big screen in Hollywood. Roland M03ller Plays Jackson in the movie.
A very entertaining movie.."
4.0 / 10,This is a Bad One,statuskuo,15 January 2018,"Folks, this is a bad movie.
It starts off great, but crashes and burns towards the end. And it's heartbreaking, since the set-up is so strong.
Without going into plot, Liam Neeson is the best thing in this train wreck (see what I did?) He is a regular joe who is thrusted in a bizarre task of identifying a person on a train for this mysterious group. Very Hitchcockian, which downshifts into typical...and unbelievable commuter train crash. Neeson literally gets thrown from one train car to the next (was ridiculous in the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie). Even as a silly action film to switch your brain off, the big mistake it makes it to make it make sense. By that, I mean, filling in details of how the game was set-up. Luckily it was not a long flick and may be casual entertainment on a slow weekend. Be warned...this is a movie you walk out of where you shake your head confused as to the talent involved that would make something so flawed."

The most frustrating thing about this movie is the beginning. The editing at the beginning creates entirely too much confusion and very hard to follow making it most unenjoyable to the point you think you've wasted money on a movie ticket.
However, once the poor editing settles down and the storyline begins to flow it grabs you and takes you on a ""train"" ride you will never forget!For new viewers, at the beginning hang in there... it gets better!"

7.0 / 10,"A very similar ""Non-stop"" so nothing better",Iliescu Victor,13 January 2018,"Perhaps the first thing that stands out about this film is the similarity between it and its older ""sibling"" Non-stop (2014). The director's mark is noticed throughout the film and it's not entirely for the best.
I appreciated that Liam did a very good job, portraying an ex-cop with some fighting skills (as he got us used with) so with his current age in mind, only good words about that.
The bad things about this movie start with the very beginning, it's slow and takes a lot of minutes until things finally kick in. Not only that but throughout the film there are several scenes that makes you question what hour is it and how long until the movie ends (even though its roughly 100 minutes of runtime). 
The action scenes, which are quite a few, are well filmed most of the time and inserted when needed but some of them feel too forced and stupid. 
At times, I found myself feeling that I was watching Non-stop yet again, the plot and action being that movie: Liam is some sort of ex-cop/fed agent in a confined space, forced by bad guys to do something. 
The film is not great, it's a good action thriller with Liam Neeson, perhaps that's what makes this movie decent and worth to watch at least once."
5.0 / 10,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,thejacobmello,8 February 2018,"The last time I was treated to a ride that this closely paralleled The Commuter's velocity, originality, and overall thrill factor, I believe I was just outside of my local grocery store on a 25 cents per go, mechanical horsey ride. Still I have to admit, dignity aside, my day was slightly better because of it.Sitting just between good and bad on the spectrum, I suppose the polite euphemism for this movie is to say that it was ""familiar."" In fact, you could probably recreate this film, shot for shot, out of footage from other Liam Neeson movies. 
While it's my sincere hope that this Ikea version of film craftsmanship is a fad, I also have to acknowledge the fact that - though, The Network, this wasn't - they told us exactly what they were giving us in the trailer, and they delivered on that promise (unlike other shit-bomb murder on a train movies released in the last six months).The acting was good, the action wasn't bad and the story was decent (I know that because if it wasn't, they probably wouldn't keep recycling it film after film) but familiarity breeds boredom, and suffice to say, even first time moviegoers seemed to instinctively smell the silent but deadly twists and red herrings bubbling up before they were squeaked out into the stale theater air.If you've seen everything else, you might wanna give this one a try but otherwise just earmark it for a good Redbox rental to have on in the background while you clean-out your inbox in a couple months.And now, an open letter to all terrorists, murderers, kidnappers, and otherwise: I know it's not easy running a business that's largely opportunistic, especially in this climate. I know this is an industry where things can go wrong in a moments notice, leaving you with little else aside from improvisation; Shit happens. I get it - but threatening Liam Neeson's family is under no circumstances a good investment. Ever.Prescriptions

,Starts well but goes off track,rogerdarlington,8 February 2018,"""The Commuter"" - a teasingly down-beat title for an action thriller - has the same director (Spanish Jaume Collet-Serra) and the same star (Irish Liam Neeson) as the earlier ""Non-Stop"" and indeed has essentially the same plot: a troubled hero with law enforcement skills trying to identify a key passenger on a tubular form of transport, last time an airliner and this time a commuter train. There is some flashy camera work, including a long shot seemingly taking us continuously the length of the train, and even an ""I'm Spartacus"" type scene.It starts really well with a Hitchcock-type scenario where a mysterious woman (played by Vera Farmiga of whom we see too little) offers a recently sacked insurance saleman who used to be a cop $100,000 if he will just find someone who is not actually commuting before the train reaches the end of the line. The tale becomes increasingly twisted and unlikely but, at the time, it is entertainiung enough with plenty of thrills and spills unfolding in near real-time."
5.0 / 10,An average action film with very few surprises,alindsay-al,6 February 2018,"So here we are again another Liam neeson action film involving a mode of transport, this time it's a train and I have seen the commuter and this is just a very average movie. The premise of the film sees a businessman forced to take up a manhunt on a train. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but has got very typecast in this role of the older action start but bit really still works for this film. He is easily the best part of this film and he still sells this likeable older tough guy very well and he can continue doing it in my opinion. But the rest of the cast are pretty poor, Sam Neil, Vera farmiga and Patrick Wilson have smaller roles in this film and they 're all as cliche as you would expect with none of them standing out in any way whatsoever. All of the suspects on the train are pretty bland characters that don't particularly feel very real or interesting at all. The story does a good job in making you root for this out of luck run down good guy and really feel for him in the situation he has been put in. But my goodness this has one of the most headshaking, confusing plots I have ever seen that is so contrived that I actually felt insulted by it in the end and feel that even non stop made more sense then this. The script has some real serious drama in it and for the most part it comes across well, however, this film tries the occasional bit of humour and it just doesn't really work very well and doesn't fit well with the rest of the film. The style of the film has some decent suspenseful scenes in it and at times had me questioning what was going on, but the action scenes and set pieces were just nonsense. One action scene in particular has so much green screen that it is totally laughable and it doesn't come across well at all. Overall the commuter is a very forgettable film that isn't really worth a watch, watch the first taken film or run all night they are superior film's to this."
5.0 / 10,"junk, but enjoyable on its own dumb terms",MisterWhiplash,6 February 2018,"My first thought seeing The Commuter as someone who lives around the area this is set... I wonder if the filmmakers have ever traveled from midtown Manhattan to Tarrytown. It's.... not very far really. This movie makes it feel like it takes 5 hours to go through. But one would wish that was the biggest gripe to have here, and that's the least of the issues around what I'd dub simply 'Dumb Strangers on a Speed Orient Express'. This really is all three of those - Hitchcock, Jan de Bont, and a sprinkling (like whipped cream on a frappuccino) of Agatha Christie with Neeson on occasion as the Irish butt-kicking Poriot - but as if it was done by someone who smoked a lot of weed beforehand. Not to mention, of course, a special effects team that sometimes tried to give us realistic looking trains and at other times decided to fully embrace that this is a Jaume Collet-Sera movie (director of The Shallows and Orphan don't forget) and have CGI schlock in the final act. The one shame in this latest Neeson thriller, it starts off with a bit more of a psychological bent. Maybe it'll simply be about the personalities on this train, who he has to track down. And sure they may be types... no, no, not may, they are, down to the bearded comic-relief guy, the dyed-haired girl who has fake ID's, and of course the Donald Trump Jr-looking stockbroker who is tied up with Goldman Sachs (and for which Neeson in a cringe-comedy moment, not intentionally, tells the audience to remember to give Goldman Sachs a big 'F-you', as if it's still seven years ago and people care, but I digress). But about midway through the film, or even two-thirds of the way in, when we are finally privy to what this *plot* all about - a real who gives a good goddamn moment - the psychological tension, if there was any there, is gone (or even, dare this even tried to go there, if Vera Farmiga who sets the whole thing in motion and makes the starkest comparison to ""Strangers"", was all in Neeson's character's just-fired burnt and desperate out 60 year old mind). It's frustrating since it has that promise of trying for something a little deeper, even if it's that shallow Hollywood deepness (or as a friend of mine might call a ""deepity""), and a solid premise for a twisty thriller. and then decides to go ""eh, screw it"" and embrace its dumb when it's almost near the end anyway. I don't think Neeson could've quite anchored this from start to finish if it had been dumb all the way through, that's not how he operates as an actor and to his credit he does more with this guy than he's done with anyone I can remember in a while. But he's also left to become another fighting tough ex-copper (that's not some big surprise, it's established fairly early on), and while it's good that the filmmakers don't make him invincible and work his age and frailties into this, it still is that Hollywood action movie frailty, where somehow the decade-long insurance man is able to snap into action when called upon the movie to do so. The Commuter is junk, in other words, but it does pass the time and isn't so stupid that it's offensive."
8.0 / 10,Train ride to the end of the line,dlwrightsman,5 February 2018,"Unlike most of the alleged experts who over analyze the movie by bringing up poor story line, unbelievable scenario and blah blah blah, I will focus on entertainment factor only.First, I am a little biased in that I and my wife like Liam's movies. OK, here it goes. We loved this movie. It was action packed and intense from beginning to end. I thought the story line was superb. Yes, not particularly believable but in today's world of crap and lying, it was what I was after as a entertaining fiction. It did not remind me of Taken or any other movie because it stood on its own story line. The special effects were superb, the characters of people on the train interesting. Liam was awesome and I will probably go see it again. BTW an awesome ending with a couple of unexpected surprises."
5.0 / 10,Well... That Was Expeted,marcgregorio,5 February 2018,"If you have seen some of Liam Neeson's movies such as Taken or Non Stop well you would probably figure out the entire story line within the span it takes you to get your popcorn and get to your seat. The story line revolves in more or less the same as it has been in the past thriller/ action movie he has been in- something or someone has been taken or that he is the only capable soul able to solve the mystery (SHOCKER!). Do not get me wrong it is decent movie, but it was definitely not a movie worth watching in the cinema. Wait for a DVD release and allow yourself the choice to stand up and go to the toilet, grab a toastie or a glass of whiskey because you would probably end up wanting the movie to end after 30 to 40 minutes of sitting down waiting for something (unexpected) to happen."
10.0 / 10,Very enjoyable nonsense,josephoneill-47629,4 February 2018,"A humorous homage to Hitchcock ,Agatha Christie (Murder on the Orient Express), and the movie Spartacus.
Hollywood at its best - ridiculous plot - full-blooded overacting - and lots of cliff hangers.
My favourite character was the junior train ticket collector - cowardly and likeable.
Nice to see the literary allusions to the Lord of the Flies, The Count of Monte Christo, The Scarlet Letter, and The Grapes of Wrath."
5.0 / 10,"It is what it is, which is enough for some",John Ryan,4 February 2018,"Boilerplate, unremarkable, dull, overlong at only an hour and 45 minutes, mostly devoid of fun, not nearly as clever as it thinks it is, only one decent action scene, insane logical leaps, plot holes, and nearly Shyamalan-esque dialogue.
 
But buried between the silliness and merely serviceable acting is enough B-movie charm and Liam Neeson being Liam Neeson to keep it from being a complete dumpster fire."

7.0 / 10,great fun but adds little to the genre.,ib011f9545i,2 February 2018,"I am not going to be too critical of this film,it is the sort of film I like and it is a good example of the type.
I did not find the plot too predictable and the action scenes are well handled.
There are some good actors in this who have very little screen time,I wonder if a lot of scenes were cut?Liam Neeson is convincing in the action scenes,unlike some actors who look like they have never been in a fight in their lives.
I don't rate this as highly as the first Taken film or A Walk Among The Tombstones but it is worth seeing."
,Neeson at his best,Figgy66-915-598470,1 February 2018,"1 February 2018
Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - The Commuter. Liam Neeson doing what he does best. MIchael MacCauley (Neeson) is travelling home on the commuter train he uses every day, and that's where his world falls apart. Approached by a stranger he is asked to do one little thing and from that point on, all hell breaks loose. This film is fast paced and incredibly tense. Shot mainly on a train we find our cast put into impossible situations as Neeson races around trying to solve the mission he's been set. There was a good supporting cast, especially the passengers on the train, there was a good cross section of people represented, from a nurse to an arrogant young stock broker and an elderly man to a student. All had a valid reason to be there and yet all were under suspicion. This film was very well written and I changed my mind many times as the plot unfolded, the twists and turns kept you completely absorbed from start to finish. Liam Neeson shone in this role and I think you could easily watch it again even if you knew the ending."
8.0 / 10,A perfectly executed routine job,kluseba,1 February 2018,"The Commuter is another movie with Liam Neeson being Liam Neeson. This time, he plays a family father who loses his job and is about to lose everything he has. On his train ride back home, he gets approached by a woman who offers him twenty-five thousand dollars if he does her a favor. As soon as the desperate man takes the money, all hell breaks loose. He is supposed to find and eliminate a witness to a crime on the train or else his family will be in danger.Even though we have all watched similar movies before like Non-Stop, also involving Liam Neeson, that had a very similar story but took place on a plane, The Commuter is one of the most entertaining movies of its kind. It takes the time to introduce the main character and how his organized everyday life shatters from one day to another which makes us empathize and even identify with the character. The plot is mysterious and tense, as more and more details about the background story emerge step by step to keep viewers focused from start to finish. Additional story elements add a few doses of energy at the right moments and even though the solution to it all isn't that hard to figure out, you still keep guessing until the end how it might all turn out.The movie obviously has a very special atmosphere, since more than three quarters of it take place on a train, in a closed environment, with a set of diversified characters. I have always liked the idea of movies, novels and theater plays based upon this idea and it's very well executed here.The special effects aren't overused which gives the movie an almost realistic touch which gets the viewers emotionally involved. Only the final twenty minutes or so are filled with spectacular action, leading to an appropriate showdown and its aftermath.The decent soundtrack complements the movie's gloomy atmosphere. The lighting techniques add a sinister tone as well. The at times claustrophobic camera angles are employed accurately. The makers of this movie clearly knew what they were doing.Even though The Commuter isn't a particularly original movie, it's a great ride and entertaining from start to finish. Go watch it at your local cinema."

The story unfolds as Neeson plays the Insurance Salesman who on his daily commute home on the train is approached by a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga, Conjuring fame) to find a particular passenger who ""doesn't belong"" and he will get $100,000 in return. Shortly here after his life spirals into a chaos that makes Northern Rail look phenomenal. 
 
The two most successful parts of this production are the leading actor and the director. They know there stuff and smash the Action genre with great success. Neeson embraces the genre with ease, reliability and hops, skips and jumps (in some scenes really far) his way through the narrative that in recent years has given him such a successful platform. 
 
The Director strives to be as creative as possible instantly proving the trapped location of the train is no trap for his creative visual style creating cool SFX shots that keep the plot rolling with speed. Particular fun is shown taken setting the stage in the opening credits fast cutting his daily commute with footage of the hundreds of times his carried out this routine, with fast cutting and shot merges we learn allot fast, kicking us into the set stage. 
 
The let down really is the script that feels particularly rushed, what could have been a wicked Hitchcockian adventure like The Lady Vanishes on acid is replaced with a almost half thought out scenerio that needs much more time in the creative oven to have been developed.
 
Great talented cast additions like Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad) and Sam Niel (Jurassic Park) are given very little to do and their skills as actors are not rewarded by great dialogue either both have pretty unexciting lines to phone in. 
 
If you can ignore weak plotting, logic and an almost shameful recreation of the ending of Non Stop at the airport you are still left with a entertaining action thriller that has clear stand out moments of suburb action from a extreamly original guitar knife fight to a cripping train crash if you let great actor/director go for it they deliver the goods. And if you had delivered them a better script I think they really could have raised the bar. In pun terms this train ride could easily have been upgraded to first class. 
 
Popcorn Thriller with some funny lines, good action and not so twisty plot."
7.0 / 10,Almost worth the journey,dj-lord,29 January 2018,"I love that Liam Neeson re-launched himself as an action guy. I thought it was a strange choice but, as Taken showed, it actually worked really well. However that fact he's now churned out 4/5 of the same film since then, it's starting to wear a little thin. As good an actor as he is, it's getting hard to distinguish between the personas he's played now in Taken/Unknown/Non-Stop and now The Commuter. Luckily there's a decent thriller/mystery plot to keep the film ticking over, solid performances from Neeson and the rest of the cast and a nicely chilling turn from Vera Farmiga. Some of the action, especially late on, gets a little OTT and silly (with some god awful CGI/green-screen) but all in all there's a pretty solid movie, story and acting holding it all together. Worth watching but don't expect anything too spectacular."

6.0 / 10,A who is it action movie,gimili,28 January 2018,"What is The Commuter? It is a movie about a man who has taken the train for the past 10 years who is offered a ""hypothetical"" situation to find a person on the train. He does not know who it is and neither do we.What I liked about this movie was the deductive reasoning behind the movie plot. It kept me engaged. You as the viewer are constantly trying to figure out who the person is along with the main character, Michael McCauley. I kept thinking to myself the person is (insert character). The problem with this suspenseful thriller is that it lacks the action packed sequences associated with other great action movies of the past. Because of this there are certain ""reality"" checks that happen throughout the film. The plot of the film is never really explained in any great detail so you are constantly wondering along with the main character why the person everyone is looking for is so important. You get a brief explanation, but nothing more. The movie just does not have the same plot and main character development as a movie like Taken. This is a one-time have fun at the movies film with enough action and suspense to be good enough so you stay interested throughout. For that, I recommend seeing the movie."
9.0 / 10,Liam Neeson doing everyman hero as only he can - and with enough twists to keep things interesting,Dave McClain,28 January 2018,"""The Commuter"" (PG-13, 1:44) reunites Liam Neeson with his ""Non-Stop"" (2014) director, Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Neeson in the underrated 2015 ""Run All Night"") for another action crime drama set in a confined space. Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a former NYC cop turned insurance salesman. Michael is having a really bad day which only gets worse when he's chatted up on his commuter train by a woman calling herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who at first just seems annoying, but turns out to be pretty deadly. Joanna seems to have targeted Michael for a job requiring his particular set of skills. She wants him to use his experience as a former cop to suss out the identity of a unspecified person on the train with an unspecified bag whose unspecified contents are very important to some unspecified (but obviously very powerful) people. Joanna offers the cash-strapped Michael $100,000 ($25,000 up front) to find the person she's looking for - and threatens the lives of his wife and son if he doesn't comply before the train reaches... the end of the line. (And she also seems able to monitor all of his activities on the train and doesn't mind offing innocent people to make a point.) It's always fun to watch Neeson try to work his way out of such predicaments - and the combination of Neeson and Collet-Serra again delivers a thrilling, action-packed mystery - with an especially good cast and creative camera work. ""A-"""
5.0 / 10,About twenty of these films are churned out every year,DylanW,28 January 2018,"The Commuter marks the fourth film director Jaume Collet-Serra works on with Liam Neeson, the star of this film. Liam Neeson, who plays fired insurance salesman and ex-cop Michael MacCauley must complete a task for Joanna, a mysterious woman who promises 100,000 USD and threatens the safety of Neeson's family. Joanna, played by Vera Farmiga (who also performs in a Collet-Sera directorial, The Orphan) performs gracefully, providing the chilling role necessary for this thriller, despite only physically appearing in two scenes. The performances were mediocre all around, including the star, Liam Neeson. Neeson, whose character was completely twisted by the scripet-writers. Somehow, Neeson's far-too unbelievable character, manages to fend off adversaries a third of his age, as well as possessing twisted morals and luck-lustre emotions. After harrowing scenes of intensity, Neeson's character shrugs it off like a stroll in the park serving as an uninteresting character, unrelateable character; whether this was due to script writing or acting, someone is to blame. The script, written in a group of five, was completely lack-lustre, beginning with an explosion of origins, but slowly fading to ash, with a completely obvious, uninventive finale. Not only that, the moments of what was meant to be ""intense"" were, in fact, as boring as watching a dog eating. Not only that, but the fight and action sequences are, completely exaggerated and over-the-top, cutting the last string of reality The Commuter held onto.This is coming from the same person who loves Mission Impossible.Watching the film, I felt unhindered having not seen Non-Stop (basically the same film as The Commuter just on a train instead of a plane) so, despite this being a new experience altogether, I still found myself disappointed, over what looked like an intense thriller (judging by the trailer) to your stereotypical thriller."
5.0 / 10,Flat and boring,tmpsvita,28 January 2018,"The fourth collaboration between Liam Neeson and the Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra gave rise to a double, perhaps it is better to say to a bad copy, of their proceeding work ""Non-stop"".
After seeing the trailer I had already noticed the similarities between the two films but this did not deter me in going to see him at the cinema, even the winning team did not change, so my expectations were quite high, I expected a thriller an engaging and entertaining action just as it had been Non-Stop, a little less so was ""Run All Night"".
The problem, however, that makes this ""The Commuter"" a real failure is the total lack of the engaging and fun action I was talking about before, the film, in fact, throughout its duration tries to dupe the viewer with some special effect here and there, only in some scenes they results functional, a very noisy soundtrack and a dynamic direction that, however, shows the quality as a director of Serra especially when he has to move in tight spaces like an airplane (Non-Stop) or, in this case , a train.
The problem is not the absurd and therefore absolutely untrustworthy subject, but the plot that, in taking itself too seriously, makes water on all sides; the problem are the really badly written dialogues that make any situation on the edge from being ridiculous or embarrassing.
And it isn't neither is the interpretation, all in all acceptable, of Liam Neeson who, despite his age, still manages to perfectly support the most ""animated"" sequences.
Each of these sequences, however, has never managed to make met have fun and at no time during the film I felt involved but rather the various problems I listed above produce the opposite effect: a boring, flat, glossy and untreated movie. 
The finish is the cherry on the cake with bad special effects and a cloying happy ending. 4,5/10"
,"Easily Liam Neeson's best ""angry old man doing action"" movie",OneEightNine Media,28 January 2018,"Ha ha ha, this film is surprisingly alright! Easily Liam Neeson's best ""angry old man doing action"" movie. This movie has something all those stupid Taken films don't have - an actual plot. The film works because it uses plot to progress the film as opposed to using action to progress the film to an obligatory hour and a half time frame. But yeah, this is a mystery action flick. Somethings are predictable but there is still enough surprise elements to keep you wondering. Plus watching Liam Neeson do his thing is always entertaining. This is a 7.4 out of 10 kind of deal but I'm rounding up to 9 out of 10 just to offset the current IMDb score."
,Great action thriller,Kingslaay,26 January 2018,"This was a great film that got better as went on. You could the intensity grow as Liam Neeson (Mike) had to find out who the secret passenger was and why. The vagueness and mystery coupled by some great action scenes made for an enjoyable film. A good cast, strong performances and interesting story to weave it together. I would not listen to the reviews and silly ratings. I would make up my own mind and watch this movie fresh. As usual many have gone with the opinion of a few. If this film is not an entertaining time at the movies then what is?7.8/10"

8.0 / 10,To find and protect the witness in the commuter,Jeanne Francoise,25 January 2018,"Dear readers, The Commuter movie has Liam Neeson as main character, so that by his reputation in acting, we can expect about fighting, conspiracy, twist plot, heroism, etc in this movie. Liam Neeson in this movie is still like acting like in Taken movie, with the mobile phone, hard voice, and story plot that is destined to protect somebody and to help his family. The Commuter is the movie about an ordinary insurance salesman, which was also an ex-cop, that has been asked to find a witness of murder that bring a bag inside the daily commuter and will be given some bunch of dollars, by a strange woman. If Neeson refused the job, his family will be in danger. Then Neeson does not have any choice, then he is walking from one wagon to other wagon, to find that witness. During his investigation, the characters in this story are developing until audience can not guess which one is the witness. Here, the commuter is representing middle-class American society that lived in urban areas, to work in the central, so that they are using commuter everyday. In the commuter, we can see ordinary men and women, looking for job, or stay in their ordinary job and because they meet each other, they are becoming closer and closer, but when Neeson ask for suspicious person, they never know. The storyline here wants to critic that even the commuter people meet everyday, they never know how is each person life outside the train after they are taking off the train. The Director also want to show us that in the train in the really daily and normal life, there is conductor, technician, daily passengers, and not-regular passengers. The camera moving is really in details as we can see train from first wagon until the last wagon, without missing the main story in just one wagon. I rate this movie 8 stars, because there are at least 2 (two) illogical plots for me, first is when Neeson is fighting, really hardly, the mobile phone is still safe from his pocket. Second is about the appearance of strange woman to direct Neeson to do strange job like that (to find a witness of murder that bring a bag in the commuter) and why she did not choose other person. Even audience will know why Neeson is chosen, but the method of that woman to find Neeson, we never know. The coincidence is not explained and what is inside the bag of the witness, seems unclear for me. Even in some critical scenes that explain everything, for me the finding of witness in the case like that, is just over-reaction. Well, maybe this is why there is movie, to live up our imagination and to see many things in different ways. After watching this movie, you can see commuter train in different way, you can see insurance sales in different way, police in different way, and witness of murder in different way. It is sure that you can not guess who is the bad and who is good until the ending. The old Neeson is still well-fighting. What a good actor."
5.0 / 10,"Not the Worst January Movie, But Definitely Lackluster",Movie Paradise,24 January 2018,"The initial concept the movie presents is actually quite interesting. It sets itself up with an interesting social question, of what people will do to protect themselves and to what lengths they will help others. This moral dilemma Michael is put in could have gone in a really cool direction, and could have made the film rather compelling. However, subsequent cliches and plot holes overtake the movie instead, and the potential for a fascinating social commentary is wasted. Upon the reveal of the final twists, inconsistencies come about. Once the story begins defying very basic logic, such as guns firing off in one compartment of the train and nobody in the neighboring compartment having the slightest idea anything is happening, it became very hard for me to stay invested. There are many improbabilities that arise, such as how certain characters know the information they do, or how all of these coincidences perfectly align. For a movie like this, you can usually forgive that kind of thing. However, the trade-off to that is that I became far less invested in the film, and thus, I am less engaged. When that happens, it becomes hard to find anything really enjoyable...

8.0 / 10,Another thrilling & suspenseful film from Liam Neeson & Jaume Collet-Serra.,Anurag-Shetty,24 January 2018,"The Commuter tells the story of Michael MacCauley(Liam Neeson). Michael takes the same subway train in New York City, from home to his place of work & back again. On one of these journeys, he gets embroiled in a sinister plot that might have dire consequences. The Commuter is an amazing movie. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has made another unforgettable film after Orphan(2009), Unknown(2011), Non-Stop(2014), Run All Night(2015) & The Shallows(2016). The combination of Collet-Serra's taut direction & Liam Neeson in the leading role, works wonders yet again. The action set pieces are mind-blowing. The climax is the highlight of the movie. The twists & turns in the film, will keep you guessing right till the end. Liam Neeson is spectacular as Michael MacCauley. Neeson flawlessly portrays his characters growing paranoia, fear, rage & desperation. Vera Farmiga is excellent as Joanna. Patrick Wilson is outstanding as Alex Murphy. Jonathan Banks is superb as Walt. Sam Neill is great as Captain Hawthorne. Elizabeth McGovern, Killian Scott, Shahzad Latif, Andy Nyman, Clara Lago, Roland Moller, Florence Pugh, Dean-Charles Chapman, Ella-Rae Smith, Nila Aalia, Colin McFarlane, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith & Adam Nagaitis are fantastic as Karen MacCauley, Dylan, Vince, Tony, Eva, Jackson, Gwen, Danny MacCauley, Sofia, Sherri, Conductor Sam, Oliver & Conductor Jimmy, respectively. The Commuter is a must watch for fans of action thrillers & Liam Neeson. Go, take this roller-coaster of a train ride!"

An enjoyable film that proves to be a good action film and also a good mystery, where just when you thought you know how it's gonna go, and soon throws you a curb. Liam Neeson is pretty good here has an ordinary guy who gets pulled in a dangerous situation. Vera Farmiga is pretty menacing even hen she is just a voice off camera. Fight scenes are pretty intense, Liam Neeson proves he still got it."

Normal people, including myself don't like troubles, this had been said, however; these organizations are nothing but troubles. Only recently after studying psychology, it was concluded that these ""they"" use ""deformed Freudian methods of communications"" which normal people cannot understand or comprehend, you have to be a moron , ( not intellect; very far from what they foolishly claim), to understand their methods of communications. The point is: demanding decent honest living with proper payments and providing good living standards aren't confrontations, or being against anybody.

5.0 / 10,A bumpy but watchable commute,TheLittleSongbird,23 January 2018,"There was a good deal of potential with 'The Commuter'. In particular that the premise was an interesting, if somewhat familiar (especially if you've seen any other action-thriller film starring Liam Neeson), one, the trailer looked good and the cast is a talented one. Watching 'The Commuter', my thoughts were that it was very much watchable that started off promisingly and had a number of good elements. But also that it was also something of a bumpy ride at the same time that derails in the third act. Very like 'Non-Stop' (except on a train rather than a plane), of which there have been comparisons to, and the strengths and flaws are similar even. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it a great film? Not to me, but have no regrets watching and certainly didn't think that it was a waste of time.Starting with the strengths, 'The Commuter' does look great, the cinematography is slick and often adds to the atmosphere created, the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab, the special effects are good and don't overload the film in quantity and the confined train location (should have been the star and very much is) creates a genuine sense of claustrophobia, a feeling maintained throughout even in the weaker stretches. The score is also suitably moody, not sounding too obvious or manipulative.Neeson is a very strong, commanding and appropriately stoic presence, as to be expected, and Vera Farmiga is a suitably cold-blooded femme fatale. Direction is atmospheric, some twists are fun and not too predictable and there is a fair share of thrills, tension and suspense.It is such a shame that 'The Commuter' does get far too over the top and far fetched in the third act, am trying to use the phrase ""felt like a completely different film"" much less but feel it does apply here with it becoming less thriller-like and more bombastic action-oriented. The film loses momentum at this point and the twists become more convoluted. The solution should have gone out with a bang but peters out, being too implausible, overblown and confused.Dialogue is hit and miss throughout but becomes increasingly hammy and vague at this point. The rest of the cast do their best but don't make much impression, being saddled with very little to do in sketchily written roles.Overall, bumpy but watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
8.0 / 10,What train movie is supposed to be.,ed,23 January 2018,"There are two kinds of train movies. One where everyone sits around and talks about interesting stuff, and the other where everything gets completely messed up. This is the other kind and it's loads of fun.What you think you know, maybe isn't so.Spoiler Alert.Several interesting themes in this one. A story middle class life being ripped apart by upper class greed, which sees an ex cop turned salesman used as a pawn in a high stakes murder coverup. Nielsons character arc goes from a nice safe financial life selling insurance suddenly into one of desperation and greed himself after he's fired without any kind of safety net. An opportunity to sure up his dire finances suddenly appears, but with it a massive amount of pressure as he's asked to solve an odd mystery and tag a witness for murder. The shadowy baddies, who use unwilling perps to commit their crimes for them, makes for an interesting metaphor of the deep state left wing government. And the a-hole police captain ends up being a nice guy after all, who's dealing with the situation as best he can, without knowing about the deception hiding reality from him..All in all a good, fun film for the thinkers, even if it's not a logical masterpiece."
7.0 / 10,"Insultingly nonsensical, but still one of the better 'Neeson' films",davideo-2,22 January 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMichael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) has just turned sixty, and is seeing out the last years of his safe, stable job in an insurance firm, only to find himself unceremoniously given his marching orders without any warning. But his day is about to get even worse, as he boards a 'commuter' train (hence the title!) that he's been doing for many years, only for Joanna (Vera Farmiga) to strike up a conversation with him, where she suggests he will receive a large sum of money if he takes out the 'missing link' on the train. This rapidly escalates into a threat, and before long MacCauley finds himself plunged into a desperate battle for survival with some mystery assailants.After the success of the Taken films, Liam Neeson found himself in a series of these similarly themed films, which feel pretty much tailor made for him and of which The Commuter is the latest. The sixty plus tough guy has a style and substance all of his own about him, that do make these films, for better or worse, at least unique. They have found a following that obviously draws in an audience, and judging by the auditorium I was in, it seems to have had a fine opening weekend.It's all really the most far fetched, ridiculous nonsense you'll ever see, pushing your suspension of disbelief to the ultimate limit and leaving you feeling slightly insulted in the process. The script seems unsure of its tone as well, framed around being a tense, claustrophobic suspense thriller, but with Neeson randomly throwing in wacky wisecracks like it's some Bruce Willis movie. There's also some unsubtle social commentary thrown in as well, regarding Wall Street fat cats and the deposed middle classes. And then there's the ending, where everything's resolved, but which chooses to really procrastinate itself, and drag everything out with meaningless exposition, wearing the viewer out.The saving grace of the film, in spite of all that, is that there is a genuinely intriguing air of mystery and suspense behind what the man has been asked to do and what the motive behind it all is, and you do want to stick with it and find out what's going on. That, and there are some tasty one on one fight scenes and thrilling action sequences that really make it what it is. ***"
5.0 / 10,Plain Trains and Autopilot.,southdavid,22 January 2018,"Liam Neeson's career renaissance as an action star continues here with ""The Commuter"", a thriller that is the very definition of passable, but cleverly released in the middle of awards season to cash in as an alternative. The film reteams Neeson with director Juame Collet-Serra, the pair having worked on ""Walk Amongst The Tombstones"" and ""Unknown"" together. This time Neeson is Michael Macauley, an ex-cop who has made a meagre living selling insurance for the past decade. On the day he's fired from his job, a stranger he meets on the train home (Vera Farmiga) offers him 05100,000 to identify which of the passengers is not who they are claiming to be. ""The Commuter"" is a generally a waste of time. It's highly derivative of dozens of similar films, and very predictable. Even before the train leaves Grand Central you'll already have worked out who the real villain is and perhaps even have a good idea as to why. But these flaws are perversely some of the films easiest selling points. Bland and inoffensive as though it is, you know exactly what you're going to get. The action scenes are passable, Neeson gamely sparring with the occasionally henchman. He takes more punishment than anyone would realistically be able to contend with, but that is a cliché of the genre. However, the stunts then get bigger, more computer generated and inversely less interesting. What is impressive about ""The Commuter"" is the depth of the supporting cast. Sam Neill, Patrick Wilson and Johnathan Banks all are in the film as former colleagues or fellow passengers. From a UK perspective, two more members of the cast will be of interest. Shazad Latif, whose career is on the rise with Star Trek Discovery, but who will always be Clem Fandango to me, has a small but significant role, and Andy Nyman, long time comedy writer and director has one of his first Hollywood roles that isn't a vocal only performance. ""The Commuter"" is far from essential viewing but maintains its averageness throughout and I can't believe that anyone who sees it, is going to care enough about it to hate it."
7.0 / 10,Liam Neeson hits people on a train,bowmanblue,22 January 2018,"I know that 'shared universes' are very popular these days with film franchises, so I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that, along with the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe,' there's also a 'Liam Neeson Shared Universe.' In this dimension Liam Neeson just wanders from one situation where he has to fight people to rescue his family. If you're familiar with the film 'Taken' (which kind of reignited Neeson's career as an elder action hero) you'll know he's more than competent at saving the day in middle age. In that he had to rescue his daughter (and beat many people up along the way). This was followed by the inevitable sequels and some other films that were basically 'Taken,' but with a different title. 'The Commuter' is one of these. However, just because it's effectively the same movie with a different coat of paint doesn't make it bad.There's not an awful lot I can say about this film that I haven't summed up in the title - Liam Neeson hits people on a train. It's pretty much your standard action movie and by no means perfect. Whenever he's on the train (which is most of the time!) the outside world speeding by looks severely computer-generated. He gets into fights and takes punishment that would put down a Terminator, there's an attempt at adding moments that you won't see coming (and you'll definitely see them coming) and parts of the plot that just probably wouldn't happen in real life.Yes, for all its numerous faults, it actually kept me very entertained. It's not overly-long and if you're either a fan of Liam Neeson's 'Taken-type' movies, or just modern action films in general, then this is something to eat popcorn to. Seeing that Liam Neeson has now beat people up on planes and now trains, I'm guessing the logical progression for his career will be for him to find himself trapped in the back of an Uber with a terrorist at the wheel and he must fight for his survival (and most likely his family's, too). And, I'm guessing I'll probably find some enjoyment in that, too (I have low standards!)."
9.0 / 10,Non-Stop train!,OllieSuave-007,22 January 2018,"This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as insurance salesman Michael MacCauley who gets bribed for thousands of dollars in exchange to killing a government conspiracy witness while boarding a train. The film starts off with some intrigue, showing MacCauley having been laid off from his job, putting him and his family's future in trying times. Audience members are asked to sympathize with this, as it reminds us of those caught in tough economic times. However, the main plot and suspense come almost immediately after MacCauley is confronted by a mystery woman, who tasks him in completing the disastrous crime if he is to value his life and the lives of his family. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as MacCauley attempts to find the perpetrator and the intended victim, all the while the casualties start to mount. The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish; it's a plot that is reminisce of another Liam Neeson film, Non-Stop. However, this flick is still fun and entertaining to watch. It is quick pace with no unnecessary fillers, and there's a smack of wit and comic relief mixed in with the intense action and thrills. Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.Grade A-"
6.0 / 10,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,autisticreviewers,22 January 2018,"Michael MacCauley (played by Liam Neeson) is a businessman and has been at the top of his game for over 10 years, and has everything he ever wants, a steady job, great friends, a very healthy family, but one day he is approached by a very mysterious stranger by the name of Joanna (played by Vera Fermiga) and she puts Michael in a ""you have no choice"" situation. He is forced to find a person on the train and kill him/her for 100,000 dollars.
In the hands of director Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Nonstop, Orphan and The Shallows) he does a pretty good job at setting everything up. The problem here is that the movie is very predictable and you can see whats going to happen 10-20 mins before it happens. The whole movie was 99% exactly the same as Non-Stop, except it was on a train. The story was the same old cliche we've seen 1000 times before, the acting was decent all round, the effects were decent, but nothing great. The pace itself was pretty good, it never gets boring and there are a few good, tense fight scenes that make the movie worth while.All in all, it's a very hard to film to review, it's a very hard film to hate, and it's a very hard film to love. Liam Neeson does what he does best which is speaking with his naturally talented Irish accent and his fighting skills make the movie all worth while to watch. It's far from a classic and it just should've been called Non-Stop 2, but it's definitely worth a watch, but maybe as a rental. Sit back on the couch with your Mars Bars and just enjoy it. 3/5 stars."

Its very unusual for Liam Neeson to be bad in a movie. He is really good here as he gives a very physical performance and he is convincing as this ex-cop. The directing here is surprisingly really good as there are many creative choices made to the story to make it above-average. The pacing is also really quick and fun as it has no scene that drags. The acting overall is good, nothing awful, nothing amazing. The only actor that is really great is Liam Neeson, the rest are fine. The script is probably my biggest issue here. The script is very obvious and its made for the audience to understand everything and there is no subtlety, which could have made the movie better. The story is very cliched, and there was rarely a moment that surprised me, aside from the directing. The cinematography can go to awful to great. There is a scene in which Michael is talking with a former friend. And the camera work is so horrific, i was getting dissy. It was hand-held and it was shaking. I didn't understood why did the director made that choice, but it was distracting. But later there is a really good action scene which is tricked to be filmed without takes. So the cinematography is 50/50 for me. Overall, this is a really entertaining movie and a very well directed one. 
6.5/10"
10.0 / 10,Beats the train derailment scene in Super 8,lunamargolis,21 January 2018,"I watched this movie last night and was absolutely carried away the entire time. And to those who say it's similar to Non Stop I answer absolutely not! The plot is entirely different with no connection whatsoever. It's much more interesting, much more action, much more mind blowing and it keeps you on edge every moment. Honestly, very few movies I've ever seen were as enjoyable as this one and I wouldn't mind watching it once every week. It's the kind of movies that never bore me no matter how many times I watch them. And on top, the performance of all the passengers was highly convincing, making the movie esvn more fascinating
Overall: my breath was taken away in some scenes and after the end I couldn't help wishing to have a similar experience on a bus or the subway or a train. It would definitely break the routine of most people's daily life"
5.0 / 10,The Unknown Commuter Runs All Night Non-Stop,starman_72,21 January 2018,"If you've seen one Liam Neeson action/thriller, you've seen them all, but who doesn't watching a Liam Neeson action/thriller? They're harmless, fun and if Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis aren't making these type of movies anymore, somebody's got to.Liam Neeson is at it again doing his usually everyman with a hidden layer of special skills: the ability to connect audience with him and care about the stakes no matter how ridiculous the scenarios a plotline throws at him (this is probably Liam Neeson's ultimate superpower, in spite of being a Jedi Knight leader of the League of Shadows and god of Narnia and ancient Greece).While the film is squarely focuses on Liam Neeson's character, it also boasts a wide supporting cast. Because there's so many, and so little screen time to give them, they've got to make a noticeable impression quickly. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the standouts, doing the most with what little time (and script) to work with. Farmiga in particular manages to create a long range of nuance and grayness in what is probably 3-5 minutes of screentime.The story itself is quite preposterous. The orchestrated scenario MacCauley (Neeson) finds himself in is unnecessarily convoluted. Another pass on the script or two should've been advised. On a positive, it did feel like a Hitchcock movie at times.Overall, I found the film to be an enjoyable matinee thriller. It's a Liam Neeson film through and through, but who doesn't love Liam Neeson?"
6.0 / 10,Expected storyline with a little surprise at the ending,zhang wei,21 January 2018,Warning: Spoilers
4.0 / 10,Action-less plot guessing repeat,daniel_haddad,20 January 2018,"The Commuter (2018) is an action-packed mystery film without a lot of the action one would have expected given actor Liam Nesson's cinematic background recently. With several slow scenes and a drawn out story line, this is not one of Neeson's better films. The film is about a business man who is down on his luck and finds himself as a player in a crime conspiracy during his normal commute home. Nesson plays his traditional bad-ass ex-cop type role very well- though one has to wonder if he is tired of his one-dimensional characters. The story itself was rather slow and it seemed to be drawn out more than it should have been. There was little character development throughout the film and I was left wanting more from just about all of it. To be fair to writers Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi, it is a challenge to have a 105 minute feature film set in essentially one location. They tried to do the most, however, the plot followed a generic story-line format of ""guy who is given a morally questionable task and then struggles with the decision of right and wrong"" and did not provide the big twist I would have expected in this type of mystery film. It once again, followed the generic plot twist one could have guessed about a third of the way through the film. Overall, The Commuter is not nearly as good as one would have hoped. Without a new and good plot, this action lacking film will not live up to most standards."
8.0 / 10,"They are really the directors of ""Non-Stop""",AMFCritic,20 January 2018,"If I had not seen ""Non-Stop"" before, this movie would seem much better to me. Because the theme is almost the same (same directors); but they change some things, still, I liked ""The Commuter"" and I think this is the best performance by Liam Neeson so far since the first ""Taken"".
In short, from the beginning ""The Commuter"" perfectly explains the life of the protagonist, the camera and the assemblies are spectacular and from the middle of the film to the end; It keeps you trapped, and leaves you wondering what will happen next? and (almost) always surprises with the twists in the story that manage to explain us in a good way the why is happening what is happening?"
6.0 / 10,Fun ride but could have been upgraded to first class,chrisjhembury,19 January 2018,"Liam Neeson reunites with action director Jaume Collet-Serra after working together on Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night now comes there latest Thriller (and Neeson's rumoured last action film) The Commuter. The story unfolds as Neeson plays the Insurance Salesman who on his daily commute home on the train is approached by a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga, Conjuring fame) to find a particular passenger who ""doesn't belong"" and he will get $100,000 in return. Shortly here after his life spirals into a chaos that makes Northern Rail look phenomenal. The two most successful parts of this production are the leading actor and the director. They know there stuff and smash the Action genre with great success. Neeson embraces the genre with ease, reliability and hops, skips and jumps (in some scenes really far) his way through the narrative that in recent years has given him such a successful platform. Image result for the commuter stillsThe Director strives to be as creative as possible instantly proving the trapped location of the train is no trap for his creative visual style creating cool SFX shots that keep the plot rolling with speed. Particular fun is shown taken setting the stage in the opening credits fast cutting his daily commute with footage of the hundreds of times his carried out this routine, with fast cutting and shot merges we learn allot fast, kicking us into the set stage. Image result for the commuter stillsThe let down really is the script that feels particularly rushed, what could have been a wicked Hitchcockian adventure like The Lady Vanishes on acid is replaced with a almost half thought out scenerio that needs much more time in the creative oven to have been developed.Great talented cast additions like Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad) and Sam Niel (Jurassic Park) are given very little to do and their skills as actors are not rewarded by great dialogue either both have pretty unexciting lines to phone in."
5.0 / 10,Liam Neeson on a train!...and that's pretty much it for The Commuter; a typical January action thriller,RforFilm,19 January 2018,"It's January. I guess that it's time for another Liam Neeson action movie. Like the Saw movies we get almost every October or every may when we get a new Marvel movie, January has become something of a tradition to receive a new movie (usually an action or thriller) that stars Liam Neeson. This seems to have started thanks to the first Taken film that was put out at that time. It's certainly not because Neeson is desperate for work. He's a great actor who has shown to have a wide range and is still casted in big movies. I think even he's self aware of these kinds of movies.Counting Taken, Non-Stop, and Unknown, they all have gruff heroes that have to stop something. And they're all put out in January. Even when they come out as bad movies, they tend to do well at the box office. This shows that Neeson is still a draw and they like him as an action hero. He has the right mix of an everyman, but can also be as intimidating as a Schwarzenegger or a Stallone. How much longer can we enjoy this? I don't know, and The Commuter seems to show no sign of him slowing down.Insurance salesman Michael MacCauley (played by Liam Neeson) commutes daily on a train to New York. His routine is just like a lot of New York workers who don't live in the city. Despite this, he remains a big part of his wife Karen and teenage son Danny's life. His day is different this time as he's being laid off to cut cooperate costs. Before heading home, he catches up with his former police partner Alex (played by Patrick Wilson). Afterword's, he catches the same train home, though he'll have to figure out how to pay for his son's college tuition.While sitting, a woman Joanna (played by Vera Farmiga) tells him that there's a bag of money in the bathroom and he'll receive $75,000 if he does a favor of finding someone before the last stop in Cold Springs. Joanna gets off while Michael inspects to see if there really is money. He finds a bag, which sets him in motion follow the favor. When he tries to tell someone, Joanna (via someone else's cell phone) has the person injured and tells Michael he has to find a person named ""Prynne"". Between a hard place, Michael searches for this person while finding a way out. If you've seen Taken, Unknown, or Non-Stop, then you've already seen The Commuter. What I mean by that is The Commuter is exactly the kind of movie that comes out in January; bland, but has enough to not make it a complete failure. The story itself, while certainly interesting, doesn't have much potential. It's like those dime store detective stories. These are the kinds of stories that are written in a heartbeat while trying to figure out how to take advantage of Liam Neeson. Neeson is the best thing about the movie. His charisma makes him charming enough to make you want to follow him. You'll never believe he's playing a character, but that's usually common with his movies. What is lacking from the other movies are his action skills, but the man is in his mid sixties, so it's to be expected. That may explain the climax of the film, which does include a train crash. The problem is that it's CGI is so obvious and fake that it looks more like a cartoon then a live action thriller. The movie works a little more in it's first half, but not by a lot.I'll give this five train maps out of ten. Those that like Liam Neeson will probably find something they'll like whether it's the actor himself or maybe even the story. It's nothing special and even the movie is aware that it's nothing special. It's another escapist thriller. I'd say if your really curious, it's worth the DVD rental later on, but I wouldn't waste money on it in theaters. Check your schedule and see if The Commuter is worth getting on now or later."
6.0 / 10,"Fun, but unspectacular",bankofmarquis,19 January 2018,"If it's January, then it must be time for another Liam Neeson action flick.Enjoying a career renaissance as a tough guy action star, Neeson, again, teams with Director Jaume Collet-Sara to bring an above average action/adventure film that puts Neeson ""on his own"" against a group of bad guys. This time around, he's an ex-cop (of course) on a commuter train heading home. When a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) stops him and offers him $100,000 to identify a person on the train, Neeson must dust off all of his ""particular"" skills to identify the mystery person.I won't spoil the rest of the plot for you (what there is of it) for there IS some fun and unexpectedness to it. What is also unexpected is the sparse amount of action there is in this action flick. We spend a long amount of time wandering up and down the aisle of the commuter train while Neeson tries to deduce who this mystery person is. This it too bad, for Director Collet-Sara has shown in other Neeson action flicks like UNKNOWN, RUN ALL NIGHT and my personal favorite NON-STOP, he can do action well. So when the action happens in this film, it is fun to watch, there just isn't enough of it, for my tastes.The acting in these sorts of films is a secondary function, but everyone involved fill their roles professionally - starting with Neeson. He has this sort of tough guy action film star thing down by now and he does not disappoint here. You know what to expect from Neeson in these films - and he delivers exactly that. Joining in are such fun ""oh that person"" actors like Farmigia as the mysterious woman, Patrick Wilson as Neeson's ex-partner, Jonathan Banks as a fellow Commuter and Sam Neil as a Police Captain who might (or might not) be involved.All things considered, this is a fun, if unspectacular, action flick. Enjoyable enough to pass the time. Certainly one that if you run across it while channel surfing on your couch you should check out. Or...if you are looking for a few hours of escape during these dark days of January, you are in capable, competent hands with Neeson and co.THE COMMUTER is a ""B"" movie - and I'll knock it down a partial grade for not being ""action-y"" enough.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
7.0 / 10,Good enough action thriller,hoangtranlovemanu,19 January 2018,"I didn't really expect too much from this movie because you know, it's Liam Neeson. The movie is not gonna be bad but it will not blow your mind either. The plot, the action scene, and pretty much everything else are all very stereotypical things in Liam's movie. However, kudos for the film for cutting right into the chase and keep the movie at fast pace. That keeps the movie still entertaining even though the concept is pretty maintream"
10.0 / 10,A who's doing it & why action thriller. CG fx fight scenes are a game changer!,tlooknbill,19 January 2018,"This movie has everything. I was thoroughly entertained.Original plot line, fight scenes that aren't just ass over elbows flying across the screen. Don't know how they did it but it shows actual fist to face contact of Liam getting his ass kicked. Very few viewer obscured camera angle trick shots. I could tell it was CG'ed but in a way that introduced blur that actually amplified the impact. A bit strange and unsettling effect that made me feel more sorry for Liam's character. The plot is intricate and believable. They do explain how Liam as an insurance salesman knows how to fight so they're not insulting the audience's intelligence. It all makes sense just like Liam's ""Taken"" movies. Grounded with a very mature tone, a welcomed respite from the current super hero venues. A lot of chess game strategic maneuvering that forces you to be fully engaged in who to trust and who's really behind the ordeal Liam's character faces. I'll be buying the Blu-Ray when it comes out. I do believe this is as good as ""Taken""."
6.0 / 10,"Entertaining enough, for a good 90 minutes.",Hellmant,19 January 2018,"'THE COMMUTER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Another Liam Neeson action-thriller, in this one he plays a badass insurance salesman who's drawn into a deadly criminal conspiracy on his daily commute home. The movie was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, marking Neeson's fourth collaboration with the director (following 2011's 'UNKNOWN', 2014's 'NON-STOP' and 2015's 'RUN ALL NIGHT'). The film costars Vera Farmiga (who also starred in the director's 2010 thriller 'ORPHAN'), Patrick Wilson (who also costarred with Farmiga in two blockbuster 'CONJURING' films), Jonathan Banks, Elizabeth McGovern and Sam Neil. It's gotten mostly average reviews from critics, and it is another hit at the Box Office for Neeson and Collet-Serra. I enjoyed it to a certain degree.Michael McCauley (Neeson) was a dedicated insurance salesman for several years, until he's suddenly unexpectedly let go. After getting a few drinks, to drown his sorrows, Michael takes his regular commute home on the train. On the ride he's approached by a mysterious woman (Farmiga), who offers him $100,000 to identify an unknown passenger. At first Michael thinks it's just a game, but when he finds the money, and people start turning up dead, Michael soon realizes that everyone on the train is in great danger.The film is entertaining enough, for a good 90 minutes, and Neeson does what he does best in an action movie. Which isn't acting sadly, because acting is actually what he does best in a non-action film. He does make a good old action hero though, and this film pretty much plays out just like all of the other B action movies he's done over the years (especially the ones by this director). The plot is slightly interesting, and slightly involving, but the movie as a whole isn't one I'll remember much of a few years from now."
6.0 / 10,Leaves the Station without a Train of Thought,popcorninhell,19 January 2018,"In the realm of bruising, brawling, nay unstoppable a**-kickers, no rise is as unexpected and as unprecedented as that of Liam Neeson's. The man is 65-years-old and has worked on an incredible diversity of films, from gritty historical epics to talkie Woody Allen romantic dramas. But with 2008's Taken, Neeson took a hard dive into action and the world hasn't looked back since.Ten years after that franchise has remorsefully petered out, Neeson still turns in the goods every once in a while, with middle of the road action movies, middle of the road budgets and middle of the road returns. It's a living - I certainly don't fault the man who is pretty much getting paid to stay in shape. Plus every once in awhile, a middle of the road action movie is really all you need to stave off all the badness in this world.The Commuter is one such film. It's modest in its presentation and definitely falls to pieces under scrutiny but it nevertheless works because it knows what it is. It's the story of a seemingly ordinary New Yorker who ensnares himself in a criminal conspiracy on his way home from work. Luckily this man, one Michael MacCauley (Neeson), has a ""certain set of skills"" that will ultimately determine whether he lives or dies by the time the train reaches its final destination.The film was directed by frequent Neeson collaborator Jaume Collet-Serra who over the last decade has been a part of the best of Neeson's late-career work. With Neeson and Collet-Serra jointly you can expect a quick pace even tone, a good setup and a couple of action sequences that elevate the film above the field of a Van Damme knockoffs. You can also expect diminishing returns but more on that later.Part of The Commuter's nut-and-bolts appeal is it's sparse to a fault. We're put into our protagonist's headspace nearly the entire time, leaving only for a brief insert here and there. Michael is in search of a passenger on the train and needs to discover their whereabouts quietly. When who, what, where and why, in short, the details, remain scant keeping the audience transfixed on what is occurring. It's mystery box filmmaking at its finest.Of course after you've meticulously setup your premise and created the max level of tension, then you have to...you know answer the who, what, when and why. To that end The Commuter derails with the force of a backyard axe kick with villains who neither need to be this flamboyant nor this dramatic. For me, my suspension of disbelief snapped back the moment we get a cutaway of two FBI agents puttering around the last stop. But if you're the type of person who'd willingly set your house on fire to kill a spider then you're probably willing to forgive most of this film's baked in nuttiness.The movie is also hacked to s**t with editing choices that completely eschew any hope of any B-story. That normally wouldn't be such a problem if it wasn't immediately clear all that stuff was supposed to be there to begin with. For example, minor characters are enshrined in the last act with a working-class dignity reminiscent of the rebel slaves of Spartacus (1960), but absolutely nothing comes before it to ground us in whom they are. It's the equivalent of starting a children's storybook with the message on the last page being read first. Also, not for nothing but if you're going to directly reference an objectively great movie; please make sure your movie reaches at least a level of competence that you can find in a Harold Becker movie - just saying."
8.0 / 10,Liam Neeson was good but just time for a break,celigirl100,19 January 2018,"He act this one good like mostly his good scene with Taken , part 2 and 3 . I expected more in this one without he beaten up a lot but I guess the director is tell him time to park him as side he . He is wash up not moving like before so that's why they give him this piece . Am sorry if I offend you Mr. Neeson but that's what most of these director doing now a days to get rid of you. Best use start to produce movies but still keep your body fit. Am surprise they didn't give Bruce Willis this movie to act he always like to be blood in his moives and get bear up lol. I watch your movie tonight and it was still awesome thank for making your fans happy ."
,Great Start NONSENSICAL Finish... WTF?,Jaque (ScottBang),19 January 2018,"I feel bad for Liam Neeson. He never could match what he achieved with ""Taken"" despite attempt after attempt. When the movie had finished all I could think of was what the hell happened to that script? The skeleton for a great film is in place and the first act was intriguing and extremely riveting. By the time it ends, everything descends in to utter nonsense. It's as if the writer of this film took months to craft half the movie and then the studio called and told him he had 48 hours to finish so he slapped together the second half jacked up on caffeine and doughnuts. Either that or his 12 year old son snuck in to his office and finished it for him. It's like the writer had no idea where this was going to start and it went out of control and veered off the tracks... quite literally. What seemed like a clever lead character turns out to be a near buffoon. The twists are obvious and everything feels like a wasted opportunity."
7.0 / 10,A Fun Thriller With Excellent Acting And Camerawork,rannynm,19 January 2018,"The Commuter is a fun thriller, even if it does get a little too over-the-top for its own good. The acting and camerawork provide a tense feel to this movie, like many Hitchcock films. This is sure to please Liam Neeson fans.The story follows insurance salesman Michael (Liam Neeson), who is caught in a criminal conspiracy on his daily commute. Michael meets the enigmatic Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who will give him a large sum of money if he finds a passenger with evidence against her. This must be done before a certain train stop. This leads to a frenetic chase to find the passenger, as elements of the conspiracy are revealed. Michael happens to be an ex-cop and will do anything to protect this passenger, but this comes with consequences.Liam Neeson, as Michael, excellently presents his frantic need to find the passenger because every wrong move can result in an innocent passenger getting caught in the crossfire. He is spectacular in the fast-paced action and stunts. Vera Farmiga as Joanna, is my favorite character because of the intense threat and urgency she provides with her performance. It is also interesting to find out more about her conspiracy. Patrick Wilson, as Alex, is an incredible helper to Michael, but you can tell he has some secrets he's not sharing. Jonathan Banks, as Walt, presents a friend to Michael who commutes with him every day, while also helping him out.Jaume Collet-Sera wonderfully directs this film with a rapid pace and you feel you are a part of the train. My favorite scene is a one-shot fight scene on board the train, because of its impressive camera work. I also like how intense it is, due to the crowded environment. My only problem with this film is that, while the main story is extremely interesting, there are many over-the-top scenarios, which turn the movie into unintentional comedy. Also, some of the filming and editing feels rushed in places.The message of the movie is that doing the right thing will never be easy, but could result in the lives of many being saved. Despite his good intentions, Michael is put into one risky situation after another and he always must risk his life. However, he saves many through his selfless acts. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, because of its intense action and language. Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. "

7.0 / 10,Another Cool Liam Neeson Action Thriller Movie,mikenontonmulu,18 January 2018,"What was wonderful about seeing Liam Neeson was that he had such a commanding presence on screen that it felt whenever he was in a movie playing a tough guy, he really nailed it. In here, he played a character who was being suppressed so hard that he had no choice but to fight back, and boy he really fought.As usual, he would be able to do the fight skillfully but not in the very fast style a la Jason Statham or Donnie Yen but his own style which was brutal and kind of like a street fight. In here, all the fights done were good, but my most favorite would definitely be the one in the small compartment before the final stop. Apart from the cool fight scenes, there were also various intense moments involving the train. The train's high speed sequence towards the end was absolutely breath taking and so intense that I was literally holding my breath. And I know my wife also screamed a little during some of those awesomely done intense moments.For a movie that was shot mostly in a confined space of a train, the early part of the film was a bit too long to my personal opinion. This resulted to a bit of a slow pace at the start. Not until the scene in the train did we feel the movie picking up the pace. Personally I think that if the earlier part was made a bit shorter, the movie would have been a nonstop thrill. To tell you the truth, I also felt a bit of similarity with another Liam Neeson's movie Non-Stop where the scenes were mostly done in an airplane. This should not come as a surprise since both were directed by the same person Jaume Collet-Sera who also directed few other Neeson's movies such as Unknown and Run All Night. I found that the sound effects of the movie was excellent and the special effects were good. It also provided us some twists and an interesting plot of finding out who the person was which kept us guessing till almost the end. The opening sequence was uniquely done but may seemed a bit confusing first, though after a while you would understand it better. The movie's main attraction would definitely be Liam Neeson who already built up a rapport for being an action star even at his age. I pretty much enjoyed the movie as it was truly entertaining though I would have loved it more had the intensity started a lot earlier. Overall it was a good entertaining movie, and one that should be enjoyed as an action thriller film.So if you are a fan of Liam Neeson and want to see his collaboration with Jaume Collet-Sera again, then this should be a definite choice. If you like this kind of genre, you would surely be entertained. And it is worth to note that during this Award period in January where the movie options were limited to heavy drama (or a horror movie), then this could be a good alternate movie.For my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
7.0 / 10,Not Your Average Ride Home,david-sarkies,17 January 2018,Warning: Spoilers
,Tall Tale,GManfred,17 January 2018,"Sometimes Hollywood goes off the rails and comes up with a story so preposterous that it's almost beyond saving. ""The Commuter"" comes very close, but the difference is Liam Neeson, who can disappear into a role and make the whole thing work. He plays Mike McCauley, an insurance man who has just been fired, and to make things worse he is sucked into an espionage story in which he has to find someone on the train home and plant a device in their carry bag. What follows makes no sense and is loaded with plot holes too numerous to mention. The first half hour sets the stage and from there it is non-stop action and tension, but don't ask questions - just watch Neeson work his magic and bring in a story which defies all efforts to explain; so don't analyze, sit back and enjoy because it is very exciting, wacky screenplay notwithstanding.****** 6 of 10"
8.0 / 10,Nearly Perfect Action + Drama + Thriller Combination,Ali Imran KAZAN,16 January 2018,"I certainly loved this one. Even in the first scenes, the artistic style of the shooting has impressed me.The bond in the family was portrayed well. Though the movie followed a way other than I've expected, the way it followed was still cool. I expected a more emotional movie, it has gotten a more action after the intro scene.Still, the action and the trill was top-notch; character developments and interactions was really good. Also I liked the way Liam Neeson solves problems; The detective way of the movie was great too. Also the message that the movie gives is strong: first it implies that ""there is nothing noble in real world"" , but then the main character changes his way of seeing things and decides to do the right thing. That was pretty impressive decision to be honest.Still, it had some failures in my opinion. GCI was -not terrible, but still- significantly bad, and it didn't fit the way movie intended to follow. I really liked the thrilling scenes, but GCI kinda killed the mood for me. Also ending was a little bit lame, that I even thought ""this movie will be a bad one in my memory forever."" but, they managed to pull through.Overall, my review for the movie is that it was amazing, and all the actors, notably Liam Neeson, did a really impressive job i think. I certainly suggest action lovers to watch it,Have a great day :)"

The setting of the train is used to full effect, and really showcases how good drama and thrills are so evocative aboard a train, as other movies have also exemplified in the past.Just amazing special effects and action, if you've ever thought that movies with great action scenes involving trains often seem to reach a higher level of electricity and excitement, then this movie will be right up your alley!The conspiratorial plot is surprisingly well told - no spoilers - but the way they set up the mysterious villainous organization is excellent, without really giving anything away to the viewer. The way it keeps you guessing, and is, in a way, rooted in real world conspiracy theories, is pretty awesome. Can't wait for the hinted sequel!"
6.0 / 10,The Guy On The Train,khairulnizam,15 January 2018,This is that movie 'The Girl on the Train' meets Liam Neeson.
6.0 / 10,A thriller train ride that may be familiar with plot but still an entertaining fun ride.,cruise01,13 January 2018,"The Commuter is a decent action thriller that brings Liam Neeson back in action in a conspiracy plot that has him trying to discover that one mystery person in a train. This is the fourth time with Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra are working together for their fourth thriller. Sure, this film may be a little similar to Non-Stop. If you could put aside for its decent plot and enjoy Liam Neeson butt kicking action, than this film will be for you. The plot follows Michael (Liam Neeson) an insurance salesman. He wakes up every day following the same routine, dealing with every day stress with his wife, and trying to figure a way to afford there son's college. Michael takes the train every day for the last ten years. When Michael's job goes awry, letting him go. His commute home on the train, he meets a stranger Joanna (Vera Farmiga) that offers him a deal of $100,000 if he can identify a passenger that sticks out from the rest of the people before the final stop. If he fails to do it, his family lives will be in danger. What I liked about The Commuter is its decent amount of action thrills. Liam Neeson trying to solve the mystery of this offer of trying to find the one passenger from a guitar player, a nurse, a tattooed girl, a snob broker, and a school girl. What does all these strangers have in connection? Or why does Joanna want Michael to find this individual? Sure, it is a fun ride when things get rolling when the threat rises when Michael has no choice cause his family's life is on the line. Watching Liam Neeson play a character that is not much of a fighter, and an insurance agent that is getting ready for retirement. He takes a beating when fighting bad guys and gets tossed around. But he gets back up to hit back and does what he does best in taking guys down. Yes, the action picks up after the first hour, and it is a wild ride from there. There is a twist in there, when you can start wondering if the villain's motivation behind all this could have been done differently. Liam Neeson is good at what he does best as an aging action star. Vera Farmiga did well as the main villain with a mastermind plan that is setting everything in motion. Patrick Wilson was also decent as Neeson's friend and an officer. What I did not like about the film is the conspiracy plot seems familiar. A little too familiar like Liam Neeson's previous films Non-stop. Except replace the concept setting to a commuter train. And than a conspiracy plan of having Neeson's character trying to solve the mystery about this individual passenger that the bad guys want him to find. And place a tracker on their bag. Leaving the fate of the passenger a mystery.Also, it does have some entertaining action with Neeson fighting guys and throwing them around the train, smashing through windows, and a brief shoot out. But the film is consist of close up camera shots with the action and a lot of camera movement which does create a little confusion on what is going on screen. Overall, The Commuter is a fair action thriller. The concept and twist were fun. Seeing Liam Neeson being fanatic in searching for that one passenger was a lot of fun and kicking back in action. Except the plot does not deliver anything new with thrills except for similar twist with the conspiracy story. And the action is nothing worth talking about.I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars. I recommend seeing the film as a rental or unless your bored and a Liam Neeson fan that enjoyed movies like Non-stop, Run All Night, or Unknown than check it out in theatres."
10.0 / 10,the commuter,baluraviuae,12 January 2018,"Superb movie ,liam neeson plays a very vital role who shoulders this entire movie,action scenes are marvellous, the fourth combo for both the director and hero is again engaging and tremendous.pls do watch in theatres."
8.0 / 10,Keeps you guessing almost till the very end.,bettycjung,16 January 2018,"1/14/18. Saw this in the theater today and it was worth seeing this on the big screen! Neeson still got it! This is an action AND psychological thriller in which Neeson's character is lured into helping a mysterious woman (Farmiga) who challenges him to find a passenger on the train who does not belong. He gets a handsome payout for doing this but it's not as easy as it sounds. Good writing keeps you guessing almost to the end as to what was going on. As good as The Sixth Sense. Really. Catch this one, it will keep you on the edge of your seat."
8.0 / 10,The Commuter Delivers at All the Stops,charlie-krausse,13 January 2018,"What did you get when you take the Producer of Non-Stop, a type-casted lead actor, a ""there's a bomb on a bus"" kind of setting and sprinkle in a little Kirk Douglas at the end? The answer - The Commuter.For Michael McCaughley today was supposed to be like every other day in his life, routine. Some of us can fully relate to his routine, and need it in our everyday life. That was when his routine jumped the tracks (to make a bad train pun).After having a horrible day, McCaughley boards his commuter train home from downtown NYC. From there a stranger approaches him and asks him one simple question, ""For $100,000, would you do one simple task?"" Intrigued and desperate McCaughley seeks to see if this conversation was real or hypothetical. Before he can even back out of it, he is already knee deep and acting against his will; trying to find and save a stranger on the commuter train as well as his family.Throw in a couple of obvious foreshadowing clues and this movie mostly delivers. Fast paced, and not just because its on a train, and it delivers at all the stops... wow, I am full of myself! charliemoviedatabase.weebly.com"

4.0 / 10,Writing this review was more entertaining than the movie. So read the review and forget about the movie!,Kapten Video,4 February 2018,"Oh boy, the first movie released in 2018 that I saw is a stinker. Hope it's not gonna predict the quality of the cinema year ahead or something.This is another addition to the mighty Neesploitation genre - Liam Neeson starring in trashy action - that got off to a promising start with 2008's ""Taken"", and has gotten steadily worse ever since.I think ""Taken"" is still the only one worthy of watching, so I won't mention the others and urge you to forget ""The Commuter"" too. After reading my review, of course. I had too much fun writing it to let it go to waste now.Running around various locations and conquering the skies in the plane have been done already, so the new location for Neeson's accidental but skillful character to kick ass is the commuter train.So... The dangerous cat-and-mouse game begins, the family is in danger (of course), Neeson has enough hero moments and ""manly man growling in manly way moments"", plus some solid supporters appearing briefly to add some dramatic heft (Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill). So far, so generic but good, hmm?What the movie doesn't have is something resembling a solid script - the beginning is OK but once the real story starts, many events or turns seem embarrassingly stupid or illogical or insufficiently explained.The result is akin to some teenager reading ""Murder on the Orient Express"", forgetting most of the story, and rebuilding it almost from scratch in modern settting.Also, there's a shortage of exciting hand-to-hand fights or action setpieces, although what they do have is gripping (pickaxe vs guitar, Neeson getting off the commuter section for the first time, how the train stops finally).Also, the beginning is too long, there's almost nothing interesting happening during the first half. I guess the makers counted on building suspense, but the story is not nearly good enough for that.By reaching the halfway point, I was feeling pretty bored already. If they didn't have budget for more action or effects or something, they should have fleshed out the mysterious nemesis character at least. Shooting dialogue and ominous looks surely ain't that expensive?I still love Neeson, and the idea of him starring in trashy action, so I wish to end with positive note. Isn't it great that a man can turn into a bona fide action star just months his 56th (!) birthday - that's when ""Taken"" was released - and still be able to do it ten years later? He truly has set an good example to us all!The director is some Spaniard called Jaume Collet-Serra who has helmed three Neesploitations previously, ""Unknown"", ""Non-Stop"" and ""Run All Night"". All are crappy also.By the way, you should do a Google image search for ""the commuter posters"", the artwork is great, much better than the movie itself!"
2.0 / 10,An excuse to sell a Liam Neeson Thriller,nickmar-31499,3 February 2018,"Is it me or was the only purpose of the entire movie was to market it as a ""Liam Neeson Thriller"" and make a lot of money on opening weekend? Honestly there was really no point to this film other than to bank on the package of what you're getting. Nothing unique. Nada. I literally felt at the end the filmmakers were saying ""surprise! You're only here to give us $15 with the expecations of a unique story with a twist... but all you got was us to find an excuse to sell a Liam Neeson thriller"" .... I cannot be the only who who feels somewhat cheated. Was very close to asking my money back, but it isn't the theater's fault I guess.If you really are on the fence... just wait to rent it on itunes but even that may end in disappointment."
10.0 / 10,The Best Film of 2018 (So Far At Least),adonis98-743-186503,19 January 2018,"A businessman is caught up in a criminal conspiracy during his daily commute home. What Kind of a Person are You? The Commuter is finally the first good film that i got to see on 2018 and it's still January, Liam Neeson's perfomance is excellent and he holds the film quite well, also the rest of the cast like Vera Farmiga, Sam Neill and Patrick Wilson were also excellent in their roles. The movie is not as action packed as i hoped but it has great pacing and an entire mystery surrounding it that kept me at the edge of my seat. Also the fight scenes were excellent especially the 2nd one. The twists are non stop coming and the 3rd act is terrific and even tho some of the cgi at times is off and it does get a bit over the top it's still an action/thriller starring Liam Neeson i mean do the math did you expect something else from him? Also there's nice communication between Neeson and the director and it shows quite well in all their projects together. Overall The Commuter is a movie that kept me entertained from start to finish and had a man that had a simple and interesting life and was on a Train every day for the last 10 years and yet combined an every day thing (with some good twists that weren't spoiled in the trailer) and terrific full of suspense action that was dazzling. (A+)"
