 3/4,,David Nusair," February 21, 2018","An obvious improvement over Jaume Collet-Serra and Liam Neeson's previous collaboration, 2015's disastrous Run All Night, The Commuter follows Neeson's Michael MacCauley's recently-sacked insurance salesman as he's drawn into an elaborate conspiracy on board a train by Vera Farmiga's mysterious Joanna - with the narrative detailing Michael's ongoing and increasingly perilous efforts at completing Joanna's seemingly simple task. The degree to which The Commuter improves as it progresses is ultimately rather shocking, as the movie suffers from a decidedly hit-and-miss first half that doesn't hold a lot of promise - with the early emphasis on Michael's train-based investigation certainly perpetuating the less-than-engrossing vibe. (There are, for example, far too many scenes of Michael harrassing various passengers as he attempts to solve the mystery.) It's clear, though, that the film improves considerably as it progresses into its watchable and sporadically enthralling second half, as certain revelations pave the way for a far more streamlined atmosphere that's rife with thrilling action sequences - including a solid hand-to-hand fight in the train's vestibule and an unexpectedly over-the-top yet entertaining derailment interlude. Neeson's typically solid work as the grizzled central character remains a consistent highlight, to be sure, and the satisfying concluding stretch ensures that the whole thing ends on a palpably positive note - which confirms The Commuter's place as a solid thriller that's ultimately far better than one might've anticipated.

 C,,Matthew Toomey," February 16, 2018","
We’re only a few weeks into 2018 but I’m comfortable in saying that The Commuter is one of the worst action films of the year.  It marks the fourth collaboration between Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra and actor Liam Neeson.  Unknown was about a guy with amnesia who had his identity stolen.  Non-Stop was about an alcoholic air marshal aboard a hijacked flight.  Run All Night was about a hitman called out of retirement to protect his son.

If you think those storylines are over-the-top, wait until you see what’s been manufactured with The Commuter.  Liam Neeson plays Michael C a successful, hardworking insurance salesman with a loving wife back home.  Scratch that.  He’s unexpectedly fired in one of the film’s opening scenes.  With his son is about to head off to an expensive college, he’s got no idea how he’ll be able to pay the tuition fees and all the other bills that will soon mount up.

It’s at this point where the mayhem begins.  Michael is on the same train he’s caught to work every day for the past ten years and is approached by a mysterious woman (Farmiga).  She cryptically tells him that “someone on this train does not belong” and if he can find out who the person is before the train reaches its final destination, he’ll be rewarded with $100,000.  If he tells anyone about the task or alerts the authorities, his family will be in jeopardy.  She provides no meaningful information aside from that.  We don’t even know what the person looks like or what they’re hiding.

After quietly walking around the train and narrowing the list of suspects (based on the ticket stubs protruding from their seats), he starts asking a few questions.  It’s not long before pandemonium breaks out with everyone looking at Michael as if he’s some kind of deranged lunatic (deservedly so) and the incompetent security being called in.  He finds a way to avoid being captured so as to continue with his investigative work.

I love a good action-thriller but the content of this film doesn’t make a lot of sense.  It’s hard to believe how those behind the assignment are smart enough to create this elaborate task (complete with a bizarre hit and run) and yet they can’t figure out the identity of the person themselves.  It’s also a struggle to comprehend how everyone on the train remains on board despite Michael’s actions.  They keep talking to him too!

I won’t spoil the finale but it’s best to lower your expectations with The Commuter.  There’s no cool, original twist that justifies the tiring opening hour.  There’s just more farce and more unrealistic plot developments.  Liam Neeson recently announced that he’s retiring from action movies and whilst it’s been a fun ride (some of his movies have been great), it’s sad that he’ll be finishing on such a lacklustre note."
,,Victoria Alexander," February 14, 2018","Too implausible, too convoluted to be a serious thriller but Neeson is all in and director Collet-Serra has obvious talent. But who can dope out the plot?

When I lived in Westchester County and didn’t want to fight traffic and then squander my monthly voodoo points on finding a parking place on the street, I’d take the Metro-North train into and then out of New York City’s Grand Central Station.

Poor 60 year old Michael MacCauley (Neeson). He’s in the same old-same old routine. Gets up, gets dressed for work, hears from his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) about the bills and his son about college tuition and then goes on the Metro-North into Grand Central Station. And if that is enough misery for the first 5 minutes of THE COMMUTER, MacCauley must sell life insurance to people who don’t need it.

Sure he’s been doing this same routine for 10 years and his numbers are good but they have a second mortgage on the their house and he just got fired. MacCauley used to be a policeman but Karen made him leave the job. If only he had waited until he made 22 years on the force like his former partner Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) is doing.

New York City police officers have a starting salary of roughly $41,000 per year. After 5 ? years the salary increases to $85,292.  Including holiday pay, longevity pay, uniform allowance, night differential and overtime, police officers may potentially earn over $100,000 per year. Optional retirement at one half salary after 22 years of service and, upon retirement, an annual $12,000 from the Variable Supplement Fund.

MacCauley knows every daily commuter. He even has a few buddies such as Walt (Jonathan Banks). So when Joanna (Vera Farmiga) sits across from him C warning sign C she doesn’t carry a handbag C and starts asking him questions like, ‘If you could go back in time and kill Hitler as a baby, would you do it?’ MacCauley points to his ring.

There are a series of thought experiment problems in moral psychology which originated with “The Trolley Dilemma”. It takes place on a train. (See Below)

Since we now have been bombarded with MacCauley’s dire financial situation, when Joanna offers him $25,000 in cash C hidden in one of the train’s bathrooms C he has to take it.

Of course there is a catch and its so convoluted and far-fetched that just go with the flow and don’t bother trying to make sense of Joanna’s all-powerful omni-presence. Joanna must be in a helicopter overhead watching inside the train and hearing everything going on. When Joanna calls him and tells him to look out the train’s window, MacCauley figures out he is really up against a secret shadow government probably run by the Jesuits, and he better make Joanna happy.

Since MacCauley was a smart detective, all he has to do is find out who is “Prem” on the train and then kill that person. Somehow, there will be a big bag of cash waiting for him at the end of the line.

If MacCauley doesn’t find “Prem”, his wife and son are going to be killed. So MacCauley has to go around interviewing everyone on the train. Instead of this being a ticking time plot, it takes one hour, 20 minutes to go from Grand Central to Cold Springs.  MacCauley takes his time.

The writers, Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle, have a neat premise but it is so improbable that you’ll exhaust yourself trying to figure out just what key fact slipped by you.

With the resources Joanna has at her disposal, you are shocked she needed to have MacCauley do the legwork for her.

Neeson is all in though in a future movie his character should be released from his ‘Daddy save me’ moral straightjacket and say, “This time, I’m looking out for myself.”

Alfred Hitchcock found the erotic charge in train travel but in the hands of director Collet-Serra its just a means to take people to jobs they hate and back to homes eating up over four hours of their day. What if MacCauley took the money, jumped off the train and ditched the phone on the train tracks. What could Joanna do then?

When you can think of something else the main character should do, there is something wrong with the plot.

Knowing New York commuters like I do C from first-hand experience C MacCauley’s fellow passengers were unrealistic seat warmers. New Yorkers see everything, hear everything and get out of the way once threat is in the air.

Hell, I can’t wait on line for more than 2 minutes and I start speaking up. Woe to Joanna if I was headed home on that train.

The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, knows how to stage fights in close quarters and the train derailment is exciting. So THE COMMUTER is for Neeson’s loyal fans and lazy fun. If only MacCauley’s loved ones were locked in the train conductor’s

tiny cabin with the dead conductor and the engineer thrown off the train and the train is on the wrong track and headed for a collision with another train. Now, you’ve got a story.

The Trolley Dilemma:

A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you C your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?

 3/5,,Jim Schembri," February 13, 2018","Once again, everyman action-man Liam Neeson encounters trouble in transit as a simple train ride home after losing his job turns into a race against the clock to locate a passenger, the punishment for failure being a world of hurt for his family. After the Taken films, Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night, Neeson has promised to end his lucrative run as a middle-aged action hero with this nifty little number. Working again with Juame Collet-Serra, who did the last three films, he’s more frantic and believable than usual, with the movie’s real-time feel adding a nice edge of urgency."
 7/10,Crítica de “El Pasajero”,Marco Cubillo," February 12, 2018","En los últimos a?os Liam Neeson ha sabido encontrar su nicho en un mercado que parece explotar al máximo cada idea o concepto que tenga aunque sea una pizca de éxito. Esa es la única forma de justificar la existencia de un filme como El Pasajero, que sin ser una mala película, nace de esta fórmula a la Taken, la cual comenzaba a convertirse en una parodia debido a la edad de Liam Neeson y a las secuelas cada vez más intrascendentes.

Pero El Pasajero se agarra precisamente de este punto para ofrecernos un thriller que a pesar de su simpleza, es lo suficientemente entretenido. Desde el primer momento en que vemos a Liam subir al tren el ritmo no decae, la propia presencia de Neeson en pantalla es adictiva. La premisa es sencilla, un aparente hombre común y corriente (pero ya un poco pasado de a?os) llamado Michael (Liam Neeson) es despedido de su trabajo y al abordar el tren que toma todos los días para llegar a su hogar, de forma inesperada se le ofrece una cuantiosa suma de dinero a cambio de identificar a una persona que no debería de estar en el tren. Michael accede solo para darse cuenta que esta en un juego mucho más grande de lo que presentía.

En esta cuarta película de Liam con el director espa?ol Jaume Collet-Serra (Sin identidad, Una Noche para sobrevivir) nos presentan un thriller con las mismas características de sus anteriores colaboraciones con la diferencia precisa de que el personaje que interpreta ya no es invencible; aquí tenemos a un Liam que se presenta como un ex-policía frágil, al que de milagro no le rompen la cara. Si bien no es un filme centrado en la acción, las cinta tiene buenos momentos, los cuales durante la mayor parte del filme se sienten acorde a lo que vemos en pantalla ― amén de la experiencia de Collet-Serra en Non-Stop Sin Escalas―. Aquí la acción si bien es turbulenta se entiende visualmente, solo es hasta la recta final que la película decae ya quese transforma en otra cosa, distanciandose así de lo que nos hizo pensar en un inicio sobre la historia.

Además de la participación del protagonista, el elenco del filme cuenta con Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson (qué polifacético es, insisto) quienes cuentan con papeles a la altura de su calidad. También podremos ver a actores como Jonathan Banks a quien tal vez recuerden por Breaking Bad y Better Call Saul, o a Sam Neil, cuya presencia le da más porte a la historia.

El Pasajero cumple al tenernos al borde de la fila del asiento, la tensión es bien llevada durante 3/4 partes de la cinta, pero como mencioné anteriormente, es al final cuanto todo cambia. La película se quiere ver mas ambiciosa de lo que trama podía ofrecer, convirtiéndola en un completo caos. Al terminar la función, tendremos la sensación de que la resolución sabe a poco después de lo que se planteó en un inicio. No será una gran película que perdure en nuestra memoria, pero logra entreteneros a lo largo de su hora y 45 minutos de duración, cumpliento así a secas con lo que promete."
 3/4,'The Commuter' is a great ride for action fans ,Linda Cook," February 8, 2018","“The Commuter” comes roaring onscreen as an entertaining actioner, a temporary cure for the winter doldrums.

The first sequences in the film are really cool to watch. Jaume Collet-Serra (“The Shallows”) cleverly shows the passage of time with quick seconds of everyday life that show a typical middle-class family living their normal routines.

The dad, of course, is Liam Neeson (Michael MacCauley), an insurance salesman who once was a police officer. Michael, who is five years away from retirement, wonders how he will pay for his son’s tuition.

And now he’s being laid off. In a scene that evokes sympathy from the audience, he has a drink with friend while he wonders how he’s going to tell his wife (Elizabeth McGovern). He boards his usual commuter train only to be approached by a stranger (Vera Farmiga) who calls herself Joanna.

She claims to be a behaviorist, and asks whether he would do “one little thing” for $100,000. His assignment is to find someone known as Prynne, whom a certain group of people seek.

Then Joanna leaves the train. Michael does indeed find money where Joanna says it will be hidden. His attempt to alert the authorities ends in disaster.

When Michael begins receiving calls from Joanna, he realizes he is being watched, and that both he and his target ― someone carrying a bag whose destination is Cold Spring ― are in danger.

Now, because this is a Neeson movie, and you’ve probably seen the trailers, it’s not a spoiler to share that a kidnapping is part of the proceedings, and that some of the characters Are Not What They Seem. It’s up to Michael, within just a few stops, to figure out exactly what’s going on and how he can stop it.

Michael must rely on what he already knows about the train, what he can figure out from what he sees around him and his professional law-enforcement experience and training to solve the mystery and save lives ― including his own.

It’s fun to watch Michael as he uses the process of elimination to try to determine the passenger he’s supposed to find. The commuters are various types, some of whom we root for and others who rub us the wrong way. There’s a great scene involving a poker game that heats up Michael’s search.

It has kind of a “Fast and Furious” vibe, in fact: It’s a great ride if you can suspend your disbelief. 

If you’re a Neeson fan, you’re sure to be taken with this popcorn flick."

 2.5/5,"Crítica de “El pasajero”, de Jaume Collet-Serra, con Liam Neeson",Diego Batlle," January 31, 2018","Enésimo thriller con Neeson obligado a entrar en acción para salvar a su familia. Más de lo mismo...
El pasajero (The Commuter, Estados Unidos-Reino Unido/2018). Dirección: Jaume Collet-Serra. Elenco: Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill y Elizabeth McGovern. Guión: Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi y Ryan Engle. Fotografía: Paul Cameron. Edición: Nicholas de Toth. Música: Roque Ba?os. Distribuidora: BF Distribution. Duración: 105 minutos. Apta para mayores de 13 a?os con reservas. Salas: 122.


Tras ser considerado durante varias décadas como un actor “serio” (recuerden Michael Collins, La Lista de Schindler o Kinsey), el irlandés Liam Neeson se convirtió en su madurez en un impensado (y muy rentable) héroe de acción. Con películas de mediano presupuesto (en las que suele interpretar a un hombre abatido por la vida que debe salir de su letargo para enfrentar todo tipo de peligros con el objetivo de defender la integridad de sus seres queridos) consiguió varios éxitos comerciales y, por eso, desde Hollywood y Europa lo siguen llamando una y otra vez para que siga en esa línea.

Otra vez con el solvente director catalán Jaume Collet-Serra detrás de cámara (ya filmaron juntos Desconocido, Una noche para sobrevivir y Non-Stop: Sin escalas), Neeson interpreta en El pasajero a un ex policía devenido en vendedor de seguros. Tras una década de esforzado trabajo en una corporación, Michael MacCauley es echado a la calle como un perro. A los 60 a?os (Neeson tiene 65), ni siquiera se anima a informarle a su esposa del despido, pese a que están inundados de deudas e hipotecas.

Tras ese prólogo de unos 15 minutos, llega la acción. Michael viaja todos los días hacia y desde su trabajo en Manhattan en el mismo tren y allí se le acercará una misteriosa mujer (Vera Farmiga, que ya había rodado con Collet-Serra en La huérfana) con una tentadora propuesta económica, pero que genera unas cuantas dudas y conlleva no pocos riesgos para el protagonista.

Comienza allí una nueva película (son otros 90 minutos) íntegramente ambientada dentro del tren en cuestión. Entre asesinatos varias, llamadas, fuerzas de seguridad y testigos en peligro se desarrollará una historia bastante absurda en su planteo, por momento arbitraria en sus resoluciones y de una absoluta medianía en su narración y en su despliegue visual.

El director de Miedo profundo, quedó dicho, es un digno cultor de los géneros, pero El pasajero no quedará dentro de los grandes exponentes del subgénero de películas en trenes (de Alfred Hitchcock a Bong Joon-ho). Una película más para él y para Neeson. Puro profesionalismo. Trabajo a reglamento."
,THE COMMUTER: All Too Familiar,Kristy Strouse," January 29, 2018","Will we ever get tired of watching Liam Neeson action/thrillers? That is the question that came to mind when I first heard about his newest Film, The Commuter, his fourth collaboration with director Jaume Collet- Serra (Non-Stop, Run All Night and Unknown). My initial response is no, but regrettably after this ride, I’m thinking the shtick may have possibly run its course.
Neeson, Fast Moving Train, Devious Plot… What can go wrong?

Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) is having a dreadful day. The former cop has been fired unexpectedly from his insurance job and doesn’t know how to face his wife and child (who is going off to college soon). MacCauley decides to meet with his ex-partner, Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) for a drink and some advice. Other cops congregate in the background, clearly a common hangout for the men in blue, particularly Captain Hawthorne (Sam Neill) who we get the idea MacCauley isn’t too fond of.

For the last 10 years he’s routinely commuted home, knowing many of the other riders. We see Michael be friendly with several as he later boards the train. Soon after finding a seat the mysterious Joanna (Vera Farmiga) settles in across from him. To be polite he indulges her whims regarding a hypothetical experiment. You see, Joanna studies human behavior, and her job is to answer one question: “What kind of person are you?” It is a concept that hardly gets its due and one that C if elaborated on C could have made for a more interesting plot.
THE COMMUTER: All Too Familiar

source: Lionsgate

All he must do is one tiny thing (her words) and he can get $100,000 with $25,000 already in the one of the train’s bathrooms. This requirement turns out to be anything but simple, as he’s forced to find a person on the train that doesn’t belong. These are the clues: they are carrying a bag, they go by a fake name, and they are getting off at a certain station.

A ruse, right? When Joanna doesn’t back down he begins to get the sinking feeling that this is real. When he finds the money, it is confirmed. But, what kind of person is he? Though he’s clearly in need of the money he’s also honorable. When a stranger delivers his wife’s (Elizabeth McGovern) wedding ring, the connotations make him realize he never had a choice.

Right from his opening entrance onto the train the camera pans to several of the commuters, giving us a variety of faces to consider. Is it the bad-mannered wall street guy, or maybe the quiet nurse who is constantly checking her phone?
Conspiracies, Set-up’s & Whodunnits

Unfortunately, right from the beginning it is also clear who he’s looking for and who is behind the conspiracy. There is not much room for speculation which hurts the film’s credibility, especially when he seriously struggles with figuring this out. Maybe the predictable nature of story won’t bother some who are looking for a fun movie night, but it didn’t help.
THE COMMUTER: All Too Familiar

source: Lionsgate

Just as he did in the Taken trilogy (his particular “set of skills”) and his previous films with Jaume Collet- Serra, he knows how to confidently play this sort of character. It is too bad, however, that this role didn’t give him more of a challenge. The Commuter isn’t either of their best. Jaume Collet- Serra’s The Shallows worked from a place of tangible fear. This movie lacks the sincerity needed to achieve that.

A very limited role by Jonathan Banks is underutilized. Patrick Wilson is also a disappointment; he’s completely adequate with what’s expected of him, there just isn’t much to his thinly constructed character. Vera Farmiga knows how to be compelling, but Joanna’s screen time is so limited that she doesn’t make enough of an impression.

I wish The Commuter had more of an identity and had less Non-Stop parallels. Michael is chosen for his familiarity with the others on board, and because of his history as a detective, but the web of deceit is bigger than he first imagines. I believe the this would have benefited from a simpler route than what was decided. Big isn’t always better. The story was created by Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi, and together along with Ryan Engle they wrote the screenplay. Their dialogue seemed too staged, setting it up for obvious knock-downs later on.
THE COMMUTER: All Too Familiar

source: Lionsgate

There is good use of the camera and for the most part the action is the best when done more intimately, specifically one scene (that might be one of its best) when Neeson fights another passenger. The draw here is in the chaotic hand to hand and the nod to just how dangerous a fast-moving train can be C swiftly reminded when he gets his head shoved out a window C as well as sharp choreography. This is also executed when Michael is forced to go below the train, engineering another irking prompt that raises the stakes.
Conclusion: The Commuter

There is a rousing quality to the first half of the movie that’s lost in the remainder. Like a ticking bomb, eventually what’s amusing is blustered by cheesy sentiments and overzealous effects. Not entirely without its merits, The Commuter is a mystery with no real intrigue and a drama without enough substance to cement itself as one of Neeson’s best. Amid the rubble there is an entertaining enough film to provide respite during the Winter blues, just don’t expect too much.

To go back to my question: Will we ever get tired of watching Liam Neeson action/thrillers? When considering The Commuter, the conspiracy element here seemed too gimmicky, the final act was too long and too loud, and cliche comments with lesser characters at the end seemed too much. In the end it still amused me, so… not quite weary yet. I am still holding out for another The Grey.

What did you think? Do you still love watching Liam Neeson movies like this?

 3/5,,Jos?? Mart??n," January 29, 2018","Liam Neeson cumple diez a?os como héroe de acción entrado en a?os y lo hace en un inmejorable estado de forma. Pocos apostaron por el aclamado protagonista de La lista de Schindler (Steven Spielberg, 1993) cuando, cumplidos los 55 a?os, decidió probar fortuna en un tipo de cine que parecía reservado única y exclusivamente a musculosos iconos del género como Stallone, Schwarzenegger o Bruce Willis, ejerciendo de padre coraje y justiciero en la trepidante Venganza (Pierre Morel, 2008). Aquella película fue un sorprendente éxito de taquilla que, además de inaugurar una franquicia que ya lleva tres capítulos, catapultó a Neeson como la estrella de acción más convincente de los últimos a?os, siendo, sin duda alguna, el realizador catalán Jaume Collet-Serra, su mayor aliado en esta empresa. Juntos han formado un tándem triunfador que, a base de una estudiada fórmula, han convertido cada nuevo título estrenado en sinónimo de entretenimiento con cierta distinción. Sin identidad (2011), Non-Stop (Sin escalas) (2014) y Una noche para sobrevivir (2015) funcionaron a la perfección como vehículos para lucimiento del Liam más físico, rodados con una pericia técnica que va más allá de lo profesional por un Collet-Serra totalmente consolidado en Hollywood como director de notables productos de serie B que siempre dan en la diana a la hora de otorgar generosos beneficios a los productores. El pasajero (2018), el nuevo trabajo del efectivo equipo, no se aparta un milímetro de las coordenadas marcadas en sus títulos anteriores, entregando más de lo mismo pero con idéntica facilidad para satisfacer las expectativas de sus seguidores con otra monta?a rusa de lo más entretenida, donde de nuevo queda de manifiesto la admiración del realizador por el maestro del suspense Alfred Hitchcock. Una suerte de variante de Non-Stop que cambia el escenario del avión por el de un tren de cercanías en el que Neeson vuelve a ser el héroe a la fuerza que se encuentra en el lugar equivocado y en el momento más inoportuno.

Uno de los mayores aciertos de este tipo de filmes es que Liam Neeson no solo se limita a repartir palizas y tiros a diestro y siniestro, sino que el actor sabe transmitir una integridad y cercanía que hace que el público rápidamente se ponga de su lado. Aquí, sin ir más lejos, se mete en la atribulada piel de Michael MacCauley, un antiguo policía que lleva una existencia feliz en el estado de Westchester, junto a su esposa (toda una alegría recuperar a una actriz tan olvidada como Elizabeth McGovern) e hijo a punto de ingresar en la universidad, hasta que llega el peor día de su vida. Con más de sesenta a?os es despedido de su empleo como vendedor de seguros y, cuando se dispone a regresar a casa en ese tren que toma cada día hasta Grand Central, en Nueva York, se ve envuelto en una oscura trama criminal. La pesadilla comienza cuando una misteriosa mujer que responde al nombre de Joanna (una Vera Farmiga estupenda pese a la brevedad de sus apariciones) le ofrece participar en un juego que, según sus palabras, pondrá en relieve qué tipo de persona es. Por una recompensa de 100.000 dólares que, sin duda, necesita, dada su situación, tiene que localizar entre los pasajeros a uno en concreto que no sea viajero habitual del tren. Como adelanto, una bolsa con 20.000 dólares que está escondida en los ba?os de la máquina ya serán suyos. McCauley entra en el juego sin saber que este es más complejo y peligroso de lo que parecía, viéndose obligado a tener que matar al pasajero X y hacerse con su bolso, antes de que el tren llegue a su última parada, bajo amenaza de muerte hacia su familia y el resto de personas que comparten trayecto junto a él. El pasajero tiene un punto de partida tan improbable como enigmático que, sin duda, acierta a captar la atención desde el instante en que Farmiga y Neeson tienen ese primer encuentro en su vagón. Otro aliciente que contribuye a asegurar el dinamismo de la aventura es que esta está contada en tiempo real, por lo que los guionistas no dejan un momento de respiro para que el vertiginoso ritmo decaiga."
 3/5,"'El pasajero': más que acción, frenesí",Alberto Luchini," January 29, 2018","La cuasi pareja de hecho en que se han convertido el director barcelonés afincado en Hollywood Jaume Collet-Serra y el actor irlandés Liam Neeson reincide en su cuarta colaboración en la fórmula que tan bien le ha funcionado en las tres anteriores, Sin identidad, Non-Stop y Una noche para sobrevivir: un tipo aparentemente normal (aunque con unas capacidades y aptitudes fuera de lo normal debidas a su pasado) debe afrontar una oscura trama que le pone en peligro a él y a su familia.

    Un filme concebido como puro vehículo de entretenimiento que como tal funciona impecablemente

Ambientada casi en su totalidad en el interior de un tren de cercanías que recorre el estado de Nueva York, la película es vibrante y frenética de principio a fin, con una muy medida alternancia entre las escenas de suspense y las de acción, todas muy bien rodadas. La variopinta galería de secundarios, todos potenciales víctimas y potenciales sospechosos, muy al estilo Agatha Christie, es otro de los puntos fuertes de un filme concebido única y exclusivamente como puro vehículo de entretenimiento y que como tal funciona impecablemente.

+ En la línea de los grandes clásicos del subgénero de trenes, le saca mucho partido al mismo.

- Da algo de pena ver para lo que ha quedado la brillante estrella ochentera Elizabeth MacGovern."
 3/5,"Review: Kafka on a Train―Jaume Collet-Serra’s ""The Commuter""",Scout Tafoya," January 25, 2018","Jaume Collett-Serra, the mathematician, the physicist, the secret philosopher, works better with infinite space in which to perform equations. His ‘bottle’ movies, where Liam Neeson is trapped in a small location with an Agatha Christie conspiracy to ferret out, show off his formal capabilities and fixations, but not his strengths. A fight scene and a train crash can no longer use Liam Neeson as anything other than a kind of stop-motion blur. So it’s probably a head-banging conundrum for Collet-Serra agnostics why a handful of critics consider his work so irresistible and satisfying. They see the movies he appears to be making, instead of the bone dry parody set in a blue screen netherworld that he’s placed just below the surface of our immediate perception. You need only watch the ending to The Commuter to understand precisely what he thinks of the subject matter he works with. At least as anything other than a stage door to the world he knows. A comically large exhale, the conclusion of his new movie finds every survivor of a nightmarish ordeal hugging their families, asking each other on dates, insisting the word “hero” go into a police report, making jokes and graciously shaking hands and smiling. It’s entirely too huge to be serious. You can practically see the Catalan whiz standing behind the monitor trying not to laugh. And that isn’t even the whole ending, it gets even hammier and smirks even more broadly for a final reveal. They look like regular movies, but they are not.
Collet-Serra’s work does occasionally get down to the business of being ordinary, of satisfying what viewers have come to the mall and paid 20 dollars to watch. Trains, planes, and automobiles are crashed. Guns are fired. Liam Neeson shouts and scowls. But where the director comes alive is in the choreography of a camera, of the calculus problems presented by his scripts. The Commuter is about probability, using variables to determine the value of X. How many passengers over what distance could plausibly be the witness to a murder committed by corrupt police? Collet-Serra’s process is usually a little more engrossing and involved, as in Run All Night (2015), where he turns an entire phantom city into a grid and builds it with his camera like he’s test-running experimental architectural software. The Commuter is a companion to Non-Stop (2014), which found Neeson, a drunk air marshal, looking for bombers among the passengers of a commercial flight. Neeson is a tipsy ex-cop on a train upstate from Manhattan in The Commuter, paid by an insistent stranger (Vera Farmiga) to find a witness. He has only a fake name, Prin, and a destination to go by. Neeson begins making a spectacle of himself trying to launch an investigation into which of the passengers is his target while the shadowy organization Farmiga works for starts killing people all around him, basically just to show him they mean business. He has about an hour before the train reaches its destination, at which point either the witness or Neeson’s family will have been killed.
The film begins with a tour de force deconstruction of reality, proof that we’re descending into the filmmaker's imaginary blue screen purgatory. Neeson wakes up, gets coffee, talks to his son about classic literature, kvetches with his wife about money, gets on his train to work, says hello to the regulars on the train, and goes to work. Collet-Serra and editor Nicolas De Toth (son of one-eyed genius André, who had a similar sense of abject irony when making his genre films in the 50s and 60s), show about a half-dozen variations of every piece of Neeson’s morning ritual, each one asking us to trust less and less about what we’re being told. The scenes of normality on repeat is a way to alert us to the coming disruption. This is what Neeson thinks is real. Like a slow-mo, Peter Tscherkassky-style loop, the more we see of his life, the less we trust and start to look past the image. Every variation tells us to ignore the incident and dialogue or to look past it to what it’s signifying, to treat his life like a monotonous trap, essentially to be on guard for the break in our understanding of his life. Collet-Serra is asking us to get excited for the murder and intrigue that’s about to happen, because it’s got to break up the patterns. He has Neeson turn into a detective again, but more to the point (and because Neeson can never ever just fit in in these movies, he’s 8 feet tall and jumping out of his skin like a coked-up hall monitor) he has him turn into a sort of grim actuary. He talks to the possible suspects and weighs whether it’s worth it for him to create a disruption, to tamper with the ‘rules’ laid down by Farmiga’s operator, watching him like a god and punishing him for putting a hair out of place.
That sense of cosmic punishment, of being literally and figuratively trapped (on a plane, a train, or a blood-feud), is key to Collet-Serra’s cinema. Going as far back as House of Wax (2005), where his heroes are encased in wax, forced painfully into the shape of other people, he sees identity as treacherously fluid and able to be corrupted. Unknown (2011) has Neeson’s identity removed and replaced and so he tries to reassert it violently. Conspiracy is a through-line in the filmmaker's work, because it’s his version of theology. Gods are out to trick us and steal from us, to take what we know―which is why the scenes of Neeson’s morning ritual are so important. In just a few minutes Serra has told us that though Neeson looks happy, his life is still just a series of minor variations on the same theme. He’s broke in all of them. The only things that change are the books he and his son read. He can live vicariously through different works of fiction, but it’s only when Farmiga-as-god corrupts the design of his life that he becomes as interesting as the stories he reads. She’s reading The Count of Monte Cristo when Neeson finds her in the final moments of the film, but the scene they’re enacting is the conclusion to Fernando Arrabal’s Architect and the Emperor of Assyria. Neeson is the emperor now and Farmiga the architect. Collet-Serra, like Arrabal, is an anarchist who flirts with the absurd―make no mistake, there is no plausible way any of his movies work in our world. There is nothing outside the blue screen windows of his world. His happy endings are not meant to be trusted, because to what ultimately is Neeson returning? The same scenes of his life, over and over, until death. This must ultimately be why the director keeps casting Neeson in all of these movies. He’s the same man with a new identity, forever trapped in a world over which he has no control. A happy ending is the only thing more absurd than a train to hades crashing, exploding and somehow sparing Neeson, a sexagenarian old growth tree of a man, from death. He needs to survive to return to the prison of his life. The chaos is always more comforting."

If x is Liam Neeson and y is the ridiculous thing that Liam Neeson has to do so that his wife/family are no longer in peril and/or jeopardy.

If you answered airplane then you’re a fool who can’t tell one high octane Jaume Collet-Serra directed Liam Neeson vehicle from another. Having successfully performed y on board a transatlantic flight in 2014’s Non-Stop, The Commuter places x on a train travelling between an American city and far-flung suburbia. And we do mean far-flung: the film was actually shot in Buckinghamshire and Surrey.

The ridiculous rules and circumstances behind this speedy venture are laid out over the opening hour. Ballymena’s best-loved export is an ex-cop who quit the department to get away from his dirty colleagues. When he’s unexpectedly laid off from his job in the insurance sector, he meets up with an old detective buddy, played by Patrick Wilson, for a conciliatory beer. Pay close attention: the bar buds, including x’s former superior Sam Neill, may well be embroiled in the film’s Borgesian set-up. Guff about crooked property deals to follow."
 2.5/4,"Movie Review: ‘The Commuter’ gives visceral look into train life, but ultimately derails",Katie Walsh," January 25, 2018","A middle-class family man is asked to do something unethical while aboard a train in “The Commuter.”

Spanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra has carved out a nice niche for himself as a purveyor of elegantly-crafted schlock. Although he started in horror, Collet-Serra has found a groove with highly efficient, extremely effective thrillers. His 2016 feature “The Shallows” became a cultural phenomenon with the simplest of premises: Blake Lively vs. shark. In his latest effort “The Commuter,” he teams up for the fourth time with his muse, Liam Neeson, for a pop noir set aboard a commuter train: “Conspiracy on the 6:25 to Cold Spring.”

Michael (Neeson) is a middle-class family man, his happy, suburban life detailed in a brilliant opening montage of mornings at home and on the way to work, on the train he’s taken for 10 years into Manhattan to sell life insurance. On this particular day, Michael is unceremoniously fired, five years from retirement, no severance, with his mortgage due and his kid imminently departing for a pricey private college.

He’s two beers deep on the train when a strange woman (Vera Farmiga) approaches him. Purporting to be a behavioral scientist, she puts forth a hypothetical question that turns out to be all too real. Would you find and do something to another passenger on this train for $100,000? Of course, it’s much more complicated than that, but as soon as Michael gets a whiff of the cash, he’s already in too deep with a shadowy, anonymous, murderous mob. He’s obligated to search for a passenger going by “Prynne.”

Trains have always made great settings for thrillers ― going back as far as 1896, when “Arrival of a Train” thrilled and terrified audiences. Collet-Serra makes good use of the limitations, opportunities and unique situations of this particular train, carrying friends, strangers and enemies alike. The jocular characters are reminiscent of the everyday folk that gave “Speed” so much of its charm.

It’s fun to imagine Collet-Serra hopping a Metro-North train from Grand Central and falling in love with the details of its specific and contained culture. Collet-Serra’s rich depiction of train life is a sensory plunge into the hustling chaos that is exacting in its precision. He and cinematographer Paul Cameron utilize visceral hand-held camerawork alongside dizzyingly elaborate zooms between punched passenger tickets. The bold style breathes life into the rather generic script by Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle, which is a serviceable mystery with some tepid social commentary about big banks and bad systems stomping on the little guy.

In the current state of Neeson’s career, he’s a man with a very specific set of skills. And here, he’s an ex-cop, trained to observe tics of human behavior and assess threats. As the mystery deepens, his goals evolve, not content with just finishing his task, but finishing the entire group that put him in this sorry mess. It’s at this point when the story, well, derails.

The twisty tale keeps pointing toward “a conspiracy,” behind the motive for Michael’s increasingly harrowing task, but it never explains what the conspiracy is, so when anyone is revealed to have been a part of said conspiracy, it falls flat. All of the elements are there for stylish and suspenseful flick, but the suspense seems to have been forgotten. Ultimately, “The Commuter” gets the job done, but it won’t get hearts racing."
 2.5/5,,Tom Glasson," January 24, 2018","Hitchcock had Cary Grant. Kurosawa had Toshiro Mifune. Now, in the modern era, Jaume Collet-Serra has Liam Neeson. The duo have worked together on four films to date: Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night and now The Commuter. This most recent collaboration features all the familar trademarks: Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a regular, everyday insurance salesman with a complicated past and a fractious family situation, who suddenly finds himself thrust into a high octane, race-against-the-clock scenario complete with double crosses, mysterious messages and plenty of dead bodies.

This time around Neeson finds himself on a train. Beyond that, The Commuter runs disappointingly close to the far superior Non-Stop. Just as it was on that terror-threatened plane, Neeson is again tasked with identifying an important passenger about whom he knows nothing. Non-compliance will result in the sudden and violent deaths of those around him. There's an early appearance by a femme fatale (here, the wildly underused Vera Farmiga), a claustrophobic fight scene and, of course, a comically over-the-top climax. But while Non-Stop managed to keep things relatively fresh, The Commuter just feels tired and increasingly incoherent.

Collet-Serra's films are often described as modern day B-movies. Whether that's meant as an insult depends on the critic C but either way, it's hard to argue that they don't fit the label. His films are wild rides that focus more on adrenalin than story; Hitchcockian pastiches that thoroughly entertain but don't always hold up under scrutiny. His best film by far is also his most reserved: The Shallows, starring Blake Lively, was a deliciously tense woman-vs-shark thriller that proved to be one of the most enjoyable (and surprising) hits of last year.

By comparison, while the filmmaker's collaborations with Neeson have unquestionably borne excellent fruit, their limitations must also be acknowledged. Neeson is a terrific actor with an extraordinary body of work behind him, yet that same gravitas works against him when playing the everyday Joe roles Collet-Serra continues to give him. He's too intense to pull off folksy charm, whilst workmanlike barroom banter (""another day, another dollar"") sounds ridiculous coming out of his mouth. The truth is, while Taken remains something of a gold standard in the annals of contemporary action flicks, attempts to replicate it with the same leading man have largely fallen short. The Commuter offers fine entertainment for a switched off brain, but little more."
 3/5,,Daniel de Partearroyo," January 23, 2018","En un mundo donde el cine de evasión nace encadenado a complicados universos narrativos con aspiraciones de prolongación eterna y los únicos destellos suelen ser de pirotecnia CGI, cada estreno de Jaume Collet-Serra devuelve a las pantallas la satisfacción del entretenimiento simple, sólido y rotundo, sin más zarandajas. Armado con pericia artesanal y ojo afilado para aprovechar al máximo el espacio y los elementos de la acción. Cuanto más directa conceptualmente sea la propuesta, más partido le saca; véase la pesadilla escuala de Infierno azul o el misterio sobre raíles de El pasajero, su cuarta incorporación al ciclo de trabajos con Liam Neeson donde el actor acumula héroes sexagenarios con orgullo obrero y facilidad para la amenaza telefónica.

Si en Non-Stop (Sin escalas) el irlandés tuvo que resolver el secuestro de un avión, aquí es el tren de cercanías que coge a diario donde se enclaustra la acción partiendo de un misterio a lo Agatha Christie CNeeson debe se?alar a un pasajero para que sea ejecutadoC con ecos del Hitchcock de Alarma en el expreso (1938). El desarrollo acrobático, el casting de ebanista (Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Sam Neill... ?hasta Clara Lago convence!) y la soltura técnica de las set pieces ya justifican el cubo de palomitas. De propina, Collet-Serra mete entre el maíz una perla: un resumen de la rutina vital del trabajador de periferia que merecería ser tan recordado como el montaje inicial de Up."
 3.5/5,,Zeenia Baria," January 23, 2018","Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) leads a contented family life and has been taking the same train to his office in New York City since the past 10 years. Things seem to be going fine when he suddenly faces financial insecurity and confides in his friend and ex-colleague, Detective Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson). Back on the train, MacCauley is accosted by a stranger ― a woman by the name of Joanna (Vera Farmiga) ― who makes him an offer too tempting to resist.

What follows next is a race against time as MacCauley faces the daunting task to save his family and uncover a web of lies. When you’re going for a Liam Neeson film, you go expecting some high octane action. And while this film may not have non-stop fast paced action, you won’t be disappointed with The Commuter either. Certain scenes have you on the edge of your seat and you’re frequently left wracking your brains along with MacCauley to figure out how to unravel this mystery.

Neeson, of course, is superb as the ex-cop-turned-insurance salesman, who finds himself caught in an incredible web of lies and deceit. Farmiga is impressive as the woman who traps an unsuspecting MacCauley. Wilson has a limited number of scenes but stands out with his character. The fluid camera work ensures that the fight sequences are seamless and believable. The film also captures the NYC subway culture, which in some ways, is similar to the daily commute in large Indian cities where we have a set of travel buddies.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who has teamed up with Neeson for the fourth time for the big screen, does a fine job of keeping the viewer engrossed thanks to a taut script, unexpected twists and turns, and solid performances by the lead actors. There is rarely a moment when the film loses momentum and you’re left guessing till the end. Overall, if you’re in the mood for some intrigue and mystery, and of course, are a Neeson fan, this one makes an interesting watch. "
 3/5,Film reviews: The Post | The Final Year | Coco | The Commuter,Alistair Harkness," January 23, 2018","Functioning as an unofficial prequel to All The President’s Men, Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers drama The Post is a timely dramatisation of the media’s determination to hold Richard Nixon’s duplicitous, dangerous and paranoid administration to account in the face of intense pressure to bury a damaging story. Contemporary parallels barely need to be spelled out here, which may be why, beyond acknowledging the film’s lightening-fast production (Spielberg read the first draft of debut writer Liz Hannah’s spec script less than a year ago and was shooting the film by May 2017), the director hasn’t bothered to make them explicit in the actual movie. Whenever The Post features the pre-Watergate Nixon C always shot at a distance through the window of the Oval office, with genuine audio recordings of his voice used where necessary C it trusts us enough to make the connection between Tricky Dicky ranting to his advisors about the media and the petulant “fake news” Twitter accusations emanating from the current occupant of the White House.

But the film works as a prequel to All the President’s Men in another way: set in 1971 and dramatising the Washington Post’s decision to publish a leaked government report detailing America’s disastrous involvement in Vietnam, it’s an origins story of sorts, examining the Post’s emergence as a nationally trusted journal that can compete with the New York Times’ enviable status as America’s newspaper of record. As such, the film gains extra contemporary relevance by shining a spotlight on the paper’s proprietor, Katharine “Kay” Graham, who was pretty much written out of All the President’s Men, but, as detailed here, was to prove instrumental in the paper’s transition from a local daily to a serious national.

Played by Meryl Streep, Graham starts the film as a powerful woman who hasn’t yet found the confidence to speak her mind. Dismissed by condescending board members as an undeserving heiress unworthy of the respect they accorded her late husband C ironic, given that he himself had inherited the company from Graham’s own father C she’s full of self-doubt and you can see her bristling as she’s expected to take a backseat in her own company for no other reason than because she’s a woman. Trying to secure the family business by taking it public, she’s got a lot to lose and the film is as much about her finding her voice behind the scenes as it is about the machinations of the newsroom. The latter is under the stewardship of executive editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks). He’s frustrated by the New York Times getting the scoop on the Pentagon Papers, so when the Times is slapped with an injunction and prevented from reporting on the story, he sees this as their moment to lead the way.

Spielberg doesn’t shy away from the old-fashioned appeal of this story. It’s a very earnest, and at times self-congratulatory, movie and it suits his sentimental side. Crucially, though, it’s not stodgy in the way that War Horse and Lincoln were. Streep and Hanks are in pure movie star mode, sparking off each other as Graham and Bradlee figure out their respective positions. Spielberg, meanwhile, keeps the story moving at a rapid clip, emulating the constant deadline pressure of a newspaper in a race against time to get the story out there. As such, he may not be able to go into a lot of detail about the origins of the Pentagon Papers themselves (that story is exhaustively documented in Neil Sheehan’s book A Bright Shining Lie), but in illuminating a lesser-known story about their publication he may just have zeroed in on the right narrative for the current moment, something underscored with a dramatic irony-drenched coda that reinforces the need for the continued vigilance of the fourth estate.

There’s no escaping the dramatic irony inherent in Greg Barker’s Obama documentary The Final Year. Following three of the president’s top advisors C Secretary of State John Kerry, UN Ambassador Samantha Power and Press Secretary Ben Rhodes C over Obama’s last 12 months in office, what might have been an interesting look at the day-to-day realities of working in the West Wing in a relatively scandal-free administration is transformed by the looming spectre of Trump into a horror movie in slow motion. It’s compelling in ways you wish it wasn’t.

The latest from Pixar, Coco starts off as a conventional follow-your-dreams story. Set against the backdrop of Mexico’s Day of the Dead celebrations, its about a young boy called Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) who just wants to sing and play guitar. This being a Pixar film, though, there’s an intriguing twist, one that actually upends those initial expectations via an elaborate magical loophole that traps Miguel in the spirit world and forces him to reckon in much more poignant ways with his family’s history and his own desire to express himself musically. It’s certainly a substantial improvement on recent misfires like The Good Dinosaur and last year’s barrel-scraping Cars 3.

Until the action literally comes off the rails in a badly rendered CGI-heavy finale, there’s some enjoyment to be had in train-bound Liam Neeson thriller The Commuter. Cast as a 60-year-old cop-turned-insurance salesman, Neeson finds himself presented with a moral quandary on the day he loses his job: help a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) identify a passenger named Prynne on his train home and he’ll receive $100,000 in cash. The catch? Prynne might not live all that much longer. It’s preposterous, of course, but the what-would-you-do conundrum gives it an amusing kick and Neeson’s hollowed out everyman is surprisingly compelling. "

 3/5,El pasajero,Israel Paredes," January 22, 2018","El pasajero supone la cuarta (y parece que última) colaboración entre el director Jaume Collet-Serra y el actor Liam Neeson después de Sin identidad (2011), Non-Stop (Sin escalas) (2014) y Una noche para sobrevivir (2015), películas que más o menos coinciden con la transformación del actor en maduro héroe de acción, lugar que venía ocupando ya desde antes pero que en los últimos a?os ha tomado una forma mucho más acentuada Cla por ahora trilogía Venganza lo atestigua- y paradójica dada su edad. Sin embargo, ha logrado en estas cuatro películas, crear una relación muy interesante con su director a pesar de la irregularidad del conjunto de las producciones, las cuales han ido de menos más gracias, en gran medida, a la evolución de Collet-Serra como director. 

El pasajero (The Commuter) - Cartel

El título original de El pasajero, The Commuter, tiene muchas más implicaciones más allá de lo descriptivo. Hace referencia al viajero diario, al trabajador que se desplaza cada día a su lugar de trabajo en transporte público, algo que en el arranque de la película el director muestra de manera excelente con un montaje de varios días diferentes en el que Michael (Neeson) se levanta, desayuna, habla con su mujer y su hijo, llega al tren… mostrando una cotidianidad diferente que continúa con un día de trabajo en el que es despedido. Ex policía y ahora agente de seguros, Michael regresa a casa cuando una misteriosa mujer, Joanna (Vera Farmiga), le introduce en una conspiración criminal: debe encontrar a otro pasajero del tren a cambio de dinero. Después, a cambio de salvar a su familia. 

El pasajero posee no pocos elementos de contacto con Non-Stop (Sin escalas): un espacio reducido para la acción (en aquella un avión, aquí un tren) al que Collet-Serra saca gran partido, un tiempo límite para resolver la problemática, que el personaje intenta salvar una situación mientras le conduce a una trampa que puede acabar inculpándolo como chivo expiatorio… en cierto modo, podría decirse que todo obedece a una idea muy particular de thriller en el que todas las piezas están muy bien armadas y encajadas, pero en el que a nivel estructural apenas hay espacio para la sorpresa. Y aun siendo así, lo cierto es que Collet-Serra resuelve el problema mediante el trabajo formal de puesta en escena, aunque irregular, con muy buenas ideas frente a algunas salidas de tono, y con un desarrollo tonal que conduce la película desde ese thriller interior, más basado en la amenaza y en el tiempo que avanza creando tensión, hacia una parte final muy enloquecida que pone en cuestión el nivel de producción de la película resolviendo en el clímax con un intento de espectacularidad que adolece de muchas cosas. 

Pero El pasajero destaca, como lo hacían las tres anteriores películas entre director y actor, de una asimilación del tipo de producto que están presentando; de un conocimiento del cine al que quiere remitirse y desea entregar al espectador. Lo cual no evita que bajo la pura acción y tensión que despliega El pasajero aparezca un contexto y un discurso de clase, con la crisis económica de fondo como detonante para algunas decisiones, en ocasiones de manera muy subrayada, en otras presentada de manera más sutil, pero que ayuda a crear una contexto moral alrededor de la figura de Michael y de las decisiones que debe tomar muy por encima de algunas producciones más prestigiosas de los últimos tiempos. Si bien algunos elementos de su evolución no quedan resueltas del todo conveniente, lo cierto es que llegado al final de la película todo queda bien dispuesto y cada elemento en su lugar, tanto a modo argumental como discursivo. Porque El pasajero funciona de principio a fin a pesar de algunos momentos innecesarios y de determinadas salidas de tono, nada importante, en realidad, que evite el disfrute de una película que no debería despacharse con rapidez porque bajo su aspecto de entretenimiento de acción Cque lo es, y eso no es nada malo- se encuentra una película inteligente y honesta a la hora de presentar su naturaleza de manera abierta, sin prejuicios y sabiendo de principio a fin en que niveles se mueve. 

Lo mejor: Aunque Neeson se presenta ya como un héroe revenido, posee un aspecto melancólico que recorre la película. El trabajo de Collet-Serra en puesta en escena y el carácter moral que imprime a la historia. 

Lo peor: La parte final muestra carencias de producción muy acentuadas."
 2/5,,Edward Porter," January 21, 2018",
 3/5,The Commuter Isn’t as Bad as You’d Think,Stephen Silver," January 21, 2018","Give The Commuter credit: Not only is a movie with Liam Neeson called The Commuter exactly what it sounds like and is advertised, but it gives you everything you might expect from an action thriller that stars Neeson, is released in January, and entails the actor fist-fighting bad guys, rescuing his family from peril and occasionally screaming into a cell phone.

The plot is wildly convoluted and the key action scenes are shot in a subpar way, but the film leans into its ridiculousness. Best of all, the Neeson Senior Citizen Action Formula doesn’t show any signs of getting old yet.

Set not in some European capital but rather New York City, The Commuter was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, also responsible for the previous Neeson vehicles Unknown, Non-Stop, and Run All Night. The Commuter injects more political consciousness than these movies typically do, with references to political and police corruption, specific shots at Goldman Sachs and the 2008 economic crisis.

Neeson plays a cop-turned-insurance salesman, who lives with his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and son, and he’s sweating his two mortgages and upcoming college tuition payments. After he’s fired from his firm, Neeson takes the Metro North train home and finds himself pulled into a vast conspiracy involving a mystery woman (Vera Farmiga), the mysterious death of a city employee, and a case of wondering which mysterious passenger he might need to find, and possibly kill.

The plot, of course, doesn’t hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny. For example, if the all-powerful bad guys wanted to kill a specific person, you’d think they’d come up with a more efficient way of doing so than blackmailing a random 65-year-old. Neeson is always standing in the exact spot on the train where the plot requires him to be standing, and the bad guys somehow are able to call any cell phone of any passenger whenever they want.

The other problem? The quality of the action. While nothing is as egregious as that infamous scene in Taken 3 when the simple act of Neeson jumping over a fence requires 15 cuts in about six seconds, the many fight scenes are somewhat choppy, and the final action sequence is especially incoherent.

So why didn’t I mind so much? I enjoyed how much the film committed to the bit, and Neeson is as magnetic as usual; it’s almost impossible to imagine this coming close to working with any other actor. Farmiga, not on screen nearly enough these days, nails a small but pivotal role, and there are also welcome turns for the likes of Sam Neill and Patrick Wilson.

It’s also a rare film that actually cares about accuracy when it comes to New York train geography, as opposed to John Wick 2, which fictionally extended the PATH train all the way North to Lincoln Center.

Can the Neeson action formula last forever? I suppose one day he’ll age out of it. But The Commuter, for all its flaws, is vastly superior to Non-Stop, the airplane version of the same general story from the same director. For about the 10th year in a row, it’s exactly what you want from a January Neeson film.

Paddington 2 Better Than Predecessor. B+

In Paddington 2, Paddington, the lovable, sweet-natured cartoon bear, goes to prison. He’s convicted and jailed for a crime he didn’t commit, and remains incarcerated for more than half of the movie’s running time. No, I’m not kidding about any of that.

And despite that counterintuitive, and very weird, hook, the film is charming and enjoyable, more so even than its 2015 predecessor. And speaking of going to jail, the film was originally set for a release from The Weinstein Company, until the Harvey implosion forced a sale to Warner Bros.

Directed by Paul Banks and based on the Paddington Bear series of children’s books by the recently deceased author Michael Bond, Paddington 2 once again mixes a Ben Whishaw-voiced CGI bear with live-action everything else, including a nifty production design of London.

Paddington 2 boasts an uncommonly strong human cast, led by the returning Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins and Peter Capaldi. They’re joined by Hugh Grant, who does a gleefully scene-chewing performance as the villain of the piece, an actor-turned-criminal.

The plot―the pre-prison part, I mean―has Paddington wishing to send a magical pop-up book to his elderly aunt, who has long dreamed of visiting London. In order to buy the book, Paddington takes a series of funny odd jobs, leading to a great slapstick gag involving the bear becoming a window washer and trying to hoist a bucket on a rope. But soon Paddington is framed for the theft of the pop-up book, and sent to the hoosegow. Where he stays, for a shockingly long portion of the movie.

The prison section mostly involves the bear avoiding the wrath of jailhouse tough guy “Nuckles” (Brendan Gleeson) and making unlikely buddies due to his friendly nature. It isn’t exactly Oz, but it somehow works and I’m still laughing at the wag on Twitter who said he saw the film and the guy behind him was complaining that the prison scenes were “unrealistic.”

I’m interested to hear the story of how, of all possible storylines for the second Paddington film, the pitch was made to build it around Paddington-goes-to-jail, and that the answer to that pitch was yes. Then again, it’s far from the worst story to come out of The Weinstein Company in 2017.

Phantom Thread Isn’t Paul Thomas Anderson’s Best. C

I completely miss the appeal of Phantom Thread. I love director Paul Thomas Anderson, and Daniel Day-Lewis is among our greatest actors. But this one, I admit, completely sailed over my head.

The film features Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock, a famed dressmaker in 1950s London. Running the business along with his sister (Lesley Manville), Reynolds meets a young waitress (Vicky Krieps) who becomes his lover.

Their relationship is contentious and volatile, and leads up to what’s actually a pretty great punchline. The problem is the getting there―I was bored for most of this film. At various times people in my audience were laughing at things that were completely lost on me.

Day-Lewis, who’s said to be retiring from acting after this film, gives his usual standout performance, even if it’s a tick below his work for Anderson in There Will Be Blood. Manville is delightfully icy as his sidekick, and Krieps brings unexpected depth as well, especially at the film’s end.

 1/5,"Hold the front row! Spielberg brilliantly evokes the golden age of newspapers in The Post, which stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks",Matthew Bond," January 21, 2018","Every year there’s a big film that underperforms come awards time, and this year it’s beginning to look as if it might be The Post. Despite starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks and being directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it won no Golden Globes (it was nominated for six) and failed to secure a single nomination either for the Baftas or the Screen Actors’ Guild awards, which are handed out tonight.

All, however, is not yet lost: the Oscar nominations are announced on Tuesday and in a normal year Streep has to do little more than cough to get herself on the list. Maybe The Post will be the film that comes with a late run… maybe.

Nevertheless, I braced myself for disappointment as I finally got to see it myself. And you can soon see the problem, particularly facing British audiences. This is a very American story involving American newspapers (The Washington Post, in particular), American politics and an American war (Vietnam), all of which came together almost five decades ago.

The Post’s finest hour C the Watergate scandal C may still have been to come but, nevertheless, this remains a serious, important and, for the most part, well executed film 

Given that it’s set during the troubled presidency of Richard Nixon, the obvious comparison is with All The President’s Men, the film about that other great Nixon-era scandal, Watergate. 

But that picture, starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford as Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, was released just two years after Nixon finally resigned. Superficially, The Post has nothing like the same immediacy. But only superficially, because what The Post undoubtedly has is context C really powerful context. Forty-seven years after The Washington Post published the so-called Pentagon Papers, there is another paranoid bully in the White House, press freedom is under real threat and the US capital is awash with lies, slander and allegations of ‘fake news’. Nixon would have felt at home. It’s this contemporary resonance that gives The Post its ‘oomph’.

Despite starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks (above) and being directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it won no Golden Globes (it was nominated for six)

So what were the Pentagon Papers? Essentially, they were made up of a hugely sensitive piece of political research which showed that the American White House, under a succession of presidents, had not only known that the Vietnam War was unwinnable but had actively and secretly expanded the scope of the war during that time. Given that there was scarcely a family in America that hadn’t sent a father, son or brother to the war, tens of thousands of whom had been killed or injured and that the war was still being fought, this was incendiary stuff.

No wonder the papers were stolen by an appalled whistleblower, no wonder Nixon wanted to keep them out of the newspapers, and no wonder the soon-to-be-legendary Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee was determined to publish them.
IT'S A FACT

Ben Bradlee's sister-in-law had an affair with JFK, revealed in her diary. In his memoir, Bradlee wrote that he conspired with the CIA to destroy the diary. 

This is a film that will delight newspaper journalists. Like Spotlight, the Oscar-winning picture from 2015 about the The Boston Globe’s exposé of a Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal, The Post captures not only the excitement of a paper on the trail of a big story C ‘My God, the fun,’ Bradlee enthuses C but also evokes a bygone era of typewriters, hot metal and those strange vacuum tubes that used to whizz our carefully sub-edited copy down to the composing room. I can see that a civilian audience might be at least one star less excited, despite the undoubted quality of Hanks’s likeable performance as Bradlee. I warmed less to Streep’s, as the well-connected owner and publisher of the Post, Katharine Graham. It’s a characteristically mannered, nervy, twitchy Streep turn, portraying a woman short on confidence, long on indecision and constantly bullied by her male subordinates.

It’s a characteristically mannered, nervy, twitchy Streep turn, portraying a woman short on confidence, long on indecision and constantly bullied by her male subordinates 

It’s no doubt accurate C Graham admitted to such ‘shortcomings’ in her autobiography C but one of the reasons it’s being ignored so far by award juries may be that it feels like the wrong performance for these angry #MeToo times, a million miles away, for instance, from Frances McDormand’s feisty, kick-male-a** turn in Three Billboards…

There’s another problem too. In making the Pentagon Papers the focus rather than Graham (now there’s a film that could have chimed with the times), an already complex and challenging screenplay has had to accommodate the fact that it was actually The New York Times that broke the story first. The Post only jumped in after Nixon had served the NYT with an injunction.

Spielberg, despite occasionally directing with a slightly heavy hand, does a good job of disguising this inconvenient truth, helped undeniably by Streep as she builds to her big moment.

The Post’s finest hour C the Watergate scandal C may still have been to come but, nevertheless, this remains a serious, important and, for the most part, well executed film. But it’s the context of today that makes it."
 3/5,The Commuter review C a bonkers pleasure,Simran Hans," January 21, 2018","In its hideously edited opening montage, The Commuter takes great pains to communicate that, yes, as per the film’s title, Liam Neeson’s cop turned insurance salesman has taken the commuter train to Manhattan every single day for the past 10 years. Unexpectedly, he is made redundant (“I’m 60 years of age, Frank!” he tells his boss), and his bad luck takes a turn for the worse when a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) chats him up on the commute home and asks if, hypothetically, he’d locate a passenger in exchange for a hefty wad of cash C or else she’ll have his family killed. Would you do it? That’s what she wants to know. As a thought experiment it’s kind of interesting. As the plot of a film? Frankly, it’s bonkers, and though it starts as a film about the financial crisis and America’s squeezed middle, it quickly turns into Murder on the Orient Express.

As far as storytelling is concerned, The Commuter is wildly inefficient, lacking basic narrative logic. Yet it’s hard not to derive some pleasure from watching Neeson fling himself about a rickety commuter train (and, in one set piece, precariously close to some train tracks), throwing insults at Goldman Sachs “on behalf of the American middle class”."
 2/5,,Paul Whitington," January 19, 2018","Liam Neeson turns 66 this June, but no one would appear to have told him that (and frankly, who would dare), because he's still knocking out cheerfully trashy action pictures by the dozen. Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night, Taken 3 - the titles trip off the tongue, but the plots are impossible to remember. All you need to know is that someone pissed Liam off and got their comeuppance.

Comeuppance takes an awfully long time arriving in The Commuter, Jaume Collet-Serra's racy thriller set aboard a New York suburban train. Ex-cop Michael MacCauley (Neeson) has just lost his job at a Manhattan insurance company and is on the train home when a glamorous woman sits down next to him. Played by Vera Farmiga, she shoots the breeze for a bit before making an odd proposition. There's someone on the train, she says, who doesn't belong: if Michael can find this person he'll be given $100,000.

But the former cop smells a rat and becomes a target himself when he realises the person they're looking for witnessed a shocking crime. Cue lots of the kind of close-quarter punch-ups old Liam can probably do in his sleep. He might as well have done in this clumsily orchestrated and preposterously plotted film, which judders to a standstill long before that speeding train does."
 8/10,,Jack Bottomley," January 19, 2018","Since making a phone call in Taken and issuing a cautionary ultimatum to some nasty sex traffickers (like there are any other kind), the action star image of Liam Neeson has grown stronger and stronger. It is remarkable to see how Neeson has flourished in this late career boom and delivered a consistent output of engaging and massively enjoyable films, be it fighting wolves in the wilderness or hijackers at high altitude. Well, despite false claims he was finished with punching people, ol’ quick hands is back in action again in The Commuter, his 4th collaboration with director Jaume Collet-Serra (The Shallows) and one hell of a fun throwback to the ‘90s.

Hard working ex-cop and dedicated family man Michael MacCauley (Neeson) makes the regular rail commute to his job but one day he is unceremoniously let go. Needing the money and at 60 years old, how ever will Michael tell his wife and kids he has lost his job? But this day is about to get interesting, as the worried commuter makes his journey home and encounters a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) on the train, who temptingly offers him the chance to make $100,000. All he has to do is find out which of the passengers doesn’t belong on the train, before it reaches its destination and tell her who it is - thus sentencing a random person to an unknown fate.

Recalling the likes of Speed and Air Force One in its kinetic thrills and unashamedly much embraced preposterous concept, The Commuter is a film that blends Hitchcockian turns and Agatha Christie-esque mystery, alongside conspiracist sub-plotting and some white knuckle pre-millennium thrills. Throwing in moments of American anger at the banking system, a few plot twists and some ridiculously enjoyable goings on, Collet-Serra creates a slick ride that knows precisely what it is and where it is heading.

So what if certain sub-plots don’t really go anywhere or if this public-transport set Cluedo game stretches realism or if the CG set piece (a nod to The Fugitive) in the final stretch is OTT? Never, does this crowdpleaser fail to entertain and with its Unstoppable-like backdrop and scenes of Neeson dispatching people with guitar heads and axes, The Commuter is an irresistibly fun ride, with its star once more being a perfect conductor for Collet-Serra's vehicle. After the paranoic intrigue of Unknown, the in-flight delights of Non-Stop (a similarly vehicular action mystery from this actor-director pair) and mob revenge beats of Run All Night, The Commuter once again shows how well Neeson and Collet-Serra work together because they understand what they are making.

As Michael, Neeson uses his believable badassery alongside his everyman charisma to anchor the movie with his commitment to its franticness. At 65, seeing Neeson clobber wrongdoers is still a stimulatingly simple but effective formula and long may it continue. The supporting cast of some familiar faces also keep you seated, with Vera Farmiga being rather creepily ambiguous in her part, her Conjuring cohort Patrick Wilson offering reliable support and it is always nice to see Sam Neill.

The Commuter is a ‘90s high concept action thriller that is well worth the fare and is another brilliant entry in the Neeson season collection! This writer only wishes more commutes were this gratifying, that said, if we ever see Neeson boarding our train we may take an early stop before all hell inevitably breaks loose.

The Hitchcockian stranger-on-a-train premise is squandered on lapses in logic and generic close-combat skirmishes. Slow-motion shots and endless tracking through the compartments further impede the flow of a deadly-dull narrative.

Worse, the director fails to make effective use of the confined space or hurtling locomotive. Heed the advice of the protagonist and take a bus instead."
 2/5,,Kevin Maher," January 19, 2018","At the Toronto Film Festival last September Liam Neeson appeared to announce the end of his late-flowering action-movie career. The Oscar-nominated actor had spent years as a worthy, if unspectacular, supporting player (see Gangs of New York, Batman Begins) until suddenly, in 2008, at the age of 56, he was cast as a world-weary action hero in the smash hit Taken.

Everything changed. He became a successful, franchise-leading ass-kicker, starring in two more Takens, an A-Team, and a series of increasingly preposterous action flicks with silly titles that sound like Viagra-wannabe brands (Run All Night, Non-Stop, The Next Three Days) and which usually featured Neeson as a former bruiser on the verge of retirement required to do something incredibly vicious and violent for the…"
 2/4,'The Commuter' Strands Liam Neeson on a Mindless Ride,Stephen Rebello," January 19, 2018","the three B-grade action flicks churned out in the past few years by star Liam Neeson and crafty, highly efficient Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra hum along with a weirdly likable, slick, machine-tooled efficiency. The duo’s newest is pretty much more of the same, only it’s sillier, less impactful and altogether worse for its lack of aspiration.

The utterly unconvincing action thriller The Commuter could just as well have been called Unknown, Non-Stop or Run All Night. For that matter, it could have called Taken. This time around, Neeson, suitably gruff, buff and weathered, plays Michael MacCauley, an ex-cop who has been monotonously gray flannel-suited, suburbanized and employed for the past decade as an insurance salesman.

A few years shy of retirement, he gets unceremoniously and brutally fired from his company. This poses some relevant contemporary dilemmas for our aging, 21st-century action hero. How’s he supposed to keep his head above water for the benefit of himself and his loving, upstate New York wife, played by Elizabeth McGovern? How will he meet two monthly mortgages payments, let alone pay the steep tuition for his college-bound son (Dean-Charles Chapman)?

Fate intervenes. During one of his otherwise routine, five-day-a-week commuter train trips aboard the New York Metro from Westchester to Grand Central Station, an enigmatic woman who calls herself a human behavior expert (Vera Farmiga doing her thing, which is fine with us) intercepts him and offers him $100K. All he has to do is to spot a certain fellow traveler in possession of a Very Important McGuffin―someone “who doesn’t belong” on that train―and plant a tracking device on him or her.
[Neeson’s] talents put him miles ahead of this nonsense, of course, but he never condescends or sleepwalks.

Although the wicked, tight-lipped femme fatale can’t or won’t give MacCauley any specific information about the target’s identity, it’s pretty clear that if MacCauley says yes, then he’s going to be responsible for someone―possibly lots of someones―getting very badly hurt along the way. But he needs the money desperately, so he tosses aside ethics and grabs the assignment. When he suffers doubts and tries backing out, scary threats and deeds begin to happenCnot only to other passengers but also to his family.

Although that’s not a bad setup for a thriller, and the mostly single-location action―a speeding train―is promising, the suspense-challenged screenplay by Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle slams on the brakes with roaring clichés and groaners (“You have no idea who you’re up against!”), and twists and turns ransacked from a grab bag of leftovers from great Hitchcock-directed thrillers including The Lady Vanishes and Strangers on a Train, let alone from other flicks like The Fugitive, Speed and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three.

Too damn much of the non-action requires the furrowed-browed Neeson to drag his 6'4"" frame and his famed gravitas from train car to car, chasing down painfully obvious red herrings and ineptly questioning “colorful” New Yorker archetype passengers―a sweet old gent (Jonathan Banks), a fiery Columbia student (Florence Pugh, a long way down from Lady MacBeth) and an eminently punchable Wall Street shark (Shazad Latif).

Neeson, in fantastic shape, is utterly professional and hits every note he can―frustration, desperation, panic, grim determinism, an everyman sense of decency. His talents put him miles ahead of this nonsense, of course, but he never condescends or sleepwalks.

As for Collet-Serra, who is rumored to be on tap to direct Jungle Cruise for Disney, let’s just says that he’s previously done much snazzier, pacier, more inventive work than The Commuter. He wisely keeps the running time down to a lean 104 minutes, but―hobbled by a trainload of inadequacies, including so-so CGI―both he and cinematographer Paul Cameron (Westworld) go way too big on flash, whip pans and whizbang effects, all in a vain effort to keep the audience from talking out loud about how little sense the whole movie makes.

Even for mid-JanuaryCtraditionally the dog days of cinema releases―The Commuter rattles along like an unreliable train to nowhere. "
 2/5,Taken for yet another risible ride with Liam Neeson: BRIAN VINER takes a journey into the absurd watching The Commuter,Brian Viner," January 19, 2018","The Taken films with Liam Neeson mercifully appear to have stopped at Taken 3 ― but this film’s subtitle might as well be ‘Taken 4: A Ride’, as our ageing action hero, again risking life and limb to save his family, this time gets into a laughably unlikely spot of bother on a commuter train heading out of New York City.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra made the 2014 film Non-Stop with Neeson, in which he crammed a plane journey with everything conceivable, and occasionally inconceivable, that might happen on board a transatlantic flight.

Here, he gives a train journey the same treatment. The Commuter is like a crazed modern hybrid of Murder On The Orient Express and Strangers On A Train, with a plot that grows less credible with every forward chug.

Neeson plays Mike MacCauley, a former cop now working in Manhattan as an insurance broker so that he and his wife (Elizabeth McGovern, almost as drippy as she was as Downton’s Lady Crawley) can see their son through college.

He has taken the same train to and from work for ten years and seems to know all the regulars on it by name, which I don’t suppose happens in New York any more than it does on the 17.45 from Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells.

On the day Mike unexpectedly loses his job, an enigmatic femme fatale (Vera Farmiga) sits opposite him on the train and makes him a bizarre offer: she will pay him $100,000 if he finds someone on the journey she needs to identify. Why she can’t find this person herself is never satisfactorily explained, but suffice to say it has something to do with a conspiracy in City Hall.

Mike is soon forced to co-operate, otherwise something terrible will happen to his wife and son, cue several fights, one or two deaths and a speeding-train-in-danger-of-derailment episode that seems to belong to a different movie.

Neeson, the consummate pro, gives his all to this nonsense, and a decent supporting cast includes Sam Neill, Jonathan Banks and Patrick Wilson. But there’s a yawning gulf here between action and plausibility. Mind the gap."
 3/5,The Commuter Review: Highly entertaining nonsense,Allan Hunter," January 19, 2018","The Commuter marks his fourth film with Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra and it is pretty much business as usual as another flawed, world-weary man is obliged to keep calm and carry on under the most extraordinary circumstances. 

Neeson's Michael MacCauley plays a former detective now sleepwalking through life as an insurance salesman in New York.

When he is laid off he heads home on his regular commuter train where the mysterious Joanna (Vera Farmiga, pictured left with Neeson) makes him an offer he cannot refuse.

In return for $100,000 all he has to do is identify a passenger before the train's last stop. Naturally it is not as simple as it sounds and he is soon embroiled in a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game. The director keeps events moving at a fair pace, emphasising the paranoia and claustrophobia of a confined space where everyone could be part of the same conspiracy.

It is nonsense but it is slick, highly entertaining nonsense."
 3.5/5,The Commuter movie review: Liam Neeson’s final action movie is a ride you don’t want to miss,Rohan Naahar," January 18, 2018","You know, a lot has been written about some of the biggest director-actor pairs in modern cinema ― Johnny Depp-Tim Burton, Leonardo DiCaprio-Martin Scorsese, Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg ― but God knows there’s a severe dearth of material written about Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra.

Of course, as compared to those duos, Neeson and Collet-Serra are working on a much, much inferior level; they’ve exclusively stuck to B-movie thrillers, while the others have won Oscars. But in the genre of their choice, they’re pretty unparalleled.

So it’s fitting that for Neeson’s self-declared final film in his surprise streak of late-period action movies, he’d reunite with the man responsible for giving him this new lease of life following the breakout success of Taken.

The Commuter is almost identical ― at least in structure ― to their previous collaborations ― Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night, all varying degrees of good. It’s a film that’s built on a clever premise, executed with absolute efficiency, but (in this case, quite literally) derailed in its final act because of some utterly preposterous writing.

By now, it’s obvious that there’s no point shooting holes in the plots of these movies. You’d only be ruining what is ― as much as I detest saying this ― were the mind to be slightly dulled, a reasonably enjoyable experience -- although even the slightest display of intelligence will almost certainly dismantle the very tracks upon which The Commuter runs.

It begins with a rather Twilight Zoney set-up: A mysterious woman approaches a daily commuter aboard a train with a proposition. The commuter (Neeson) has never seen her before, and he’s been doing this trip twice a day for 10 years. The woman (Vera Farmiga, reuniting with Collet-Serra for the first time since the glorious horror movie, Orphan) proposes a ‘hypothetical’ scenario to Neeson. She gives him a choice: if he agrees to accept, he’d have to identify one passenger on the train who isn’t supposed to be on it, and he’d receive a $100,000 cash reward. Something will happen to that unidentified passenger, but Neeson’s character would not be made aware of it. His job would be to simply identify the person, and return to his mundane life.

However ― and the woman doesn’t tell him this ― if he were he to accept the offer and fail, or in any way try and disrupt what has been set in motion, there’d be consequences: His wife and kid would be harmed.

And since Neeson’s character was fired that very day (by the way, has there ever been a more fool-proof way to get the audience on the protagonist’s side than to fire him from his job?), he accepts. Soon, like the characters in Richard Matheson’s near-identical short story, The Box, which was later made into a film by Richard Kelly, Neeson’s character realises that by compromising on his morals, he has been taken hostage by the mysterious woman. He is compelled to fulfil the task, or face the tragic consequences.

Now, I know what you’re thinking (at least, if you’re fans of Neeson’s recent action movies). This sounds an awful lot like Non-Stop, the only difference is that instead of a plane, it’s set on a moving train.

And honestly, to an extent, it really is Non-Stop on a train. Like that movie, it’s a fun little throwback to the locked room mysteries of Agatha Christie (how neat to have another so soon after the wonderful Murder on the Orient Express) and more overtly, the deftly plotted thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock (it leans more towards The Lady Vanishes than Strangers on a Train, though).

In the hands of Collet-Serra, The Commuter is an effortlessly mounted thriller that’s infinitely better than those terrible Taken sequels. For instance, there is one action scene in particular that seems as though it is a direct response to that endlessly memed sequence from Taken 3 in which the visibly old Neeson leaps a fence with the aid of a dozen cuts: it’s an entire fistfight that (with the obvious help of some seamless editing) is made to appear as if it were shot in one long take.

The same goes for the film’s opening credits sequence, in which they relate Neeson’s daily routine with insight and grace uncommon to films such as this. This sort of attention to detail isn’t something you’d ever really demand of movies like The Commuter, but nonetheless, the effort is appreciated.

The Commuter isn’t the blazing swansong every Liam Neeson fan would’ve hoped for ― and to be quite honest, with these things, you never know; he might do another action movie sometime in the future. But it has, like it’s central character, a workmanlike demeanour that’s bound to please its fans. There are even brief moments of depth, if you’re into that sort of thing: banks, and the evil they represent, is a recurring motif.

Without spoiling anything, I regret to inform you that as usual, the mystery was ruined for me based only on the casting. If you get the hint, then you understand what a pain this trend is, but if you don’t, lucky you."
 3/5,The Commuter is your typical Liam Neeson action-packed film and yet it’s still filled with huge plot holes,Jamie East," January 18, 2018","This is not Schindler’s List Liam - this is Neeson PROTECTING HIS FAMILY AND SO HELP ME GOD IF YOU STAND IN HIS WAY.

He’s Michael MacCauley - a gruff ex-cop (what else) turned insurance salesman, stuck on the boring commute and grindstone, day in-day out, happy but skint.

After getting the sack for being nearly 60, Michael gets a mysterious proposition from a glamorous woman on the train home involving a large bag of cash for identifying a fellow passenger who’s witnessed a terrible crime and is about to go into FBI protection.

Oh, and if he says no, “they” will kill his family.Cue a good 90 minutes or so of fast-paced, twisty whodunnit wrapped up with whiffs of Source Code, Speed and Die Hard.

It’s preposterous, there are plot holes bigger than the tunnels they ride through (If the “they” are so evil, dangerous and powerful why not just do the job themselves?) and it’s cliché ridden, but by god it’s lot of fun."
 4/5,The Commuter review: a punchy Liam Neeson thrill ride in full embrace of its own brilliant stupidity,Adam White," January 18, 2018","In The Commuter, Liam Neeson allegedly plays an insurance manager named Michael McCauley. But we all know he may as well just be playing “Liam Neeson”. In the decade since he told the sex trafficker responsible for his daughter’s kidnapping in Taken that he has “a very particular set of skills”, emerging as a bonafide action star in the process, Liam Neeson has become a film genre unto himself.

Few will remember the specific plots of the Neeson action canon C quite why he lost his identity in Unknown, or shot people on that plane in Non-Stop, or which particular 40-something leading lady played which wife or love interest in which indistinguishable thriller from a few years ago.

But it doesn’t matter at all, either. We don’t see movies like The Commuter for logical plots or quality acting, we see them because Neeson is shorthand for popcorn and 90-minute roller coaster rides. So in the spirit of the Neeson genre, we adjust our perceptions of good filmmaking accordingly.

As dramatised in an impressive opening montage cross-cutting between different seasons and different weather conditions but anchored by the same strikingly dull specifics of his morning commute into New York City, The Commuter’s hero has gotten used to routine.

But when Michael is fired from his job just as his son prepares to apply for colleges, a setback that could leave him and his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) financially destitute, he gives an unusual offer more credence than usual.

Appearing incongruously on his regular commuter train is a mystery woman played by Vera Farmiga, who proceeds to dangle Neeson a faustian carrot: identify a passenger on board “who doesn’t belong”, plant a tracking device on them, and collect a large sum of money for his efforts. He won’t know why he’s done it, or what will happen to the passenger in question, but the cash will be his.

Because this is a Liam Neeson movie, Michael quickly discovers that Farmiga’s scheme is far bigger than the moral dilemma she flirtatiously described, particularly when his wife and son are threatened with abduction and he learns that Farmiga’s “people” can orchestrate very public acts of murder at the drop of a hat.

Also because this is a Liam Neeson movie, Farmiga hadn’t realised that Michael is a former cop, giving him both the psychological know-how to unravel an elaborate conspiracy between stations and punch people really, really well.
The Commuter
The Commuter

The Commuter marks the fourth collaboration between Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra, Hollywood’s heir to B-movie kings of yesteryear like Jan De Bont and Tony Scott. His films, including Neeson’s Unknown (2011), Non-Stop (2014) and Run All Night (2015), feel directly conjured from the mind of a studio executive randomly spitballing while under the control of an illegal substance. “Get me one of the stars of Gossip Girl fighting a shark for 90 minutes!” they yelp. “Murder Paris Hilton in a wax museum for me!”

The Commuter can be just as easily broken down to a simple pitch, swapping Liam Neeson on a plane for Liam Neeson on a train in what sometimes feels like a spiritual sequel to Non-Stop, which also saw Neeson throwing punches on board mass transportation. And like Non-Stop, it’s a Hitchcock-aping thrill ride in full embrace of its own brilliant stupidity.

As director, Collet-Serra fully upends any potential drawbacks to creating action in such a confined space, with Neeson clinging on both underneath and outside of the train at various junctures, while he even finds time for a fourth-act hostage crisis just when you think this specific mode of transportation has long run out of gas.

The fight choreography is equally impressive, particularly an extended action sequence involving a gun, an axe and a left-handed guitar. And outside of an abundance of dodgy American accents on display, you’d have no idea that most of The Commuter was filmed at Pinewood.

It doesn’t quite stick the landing (following up the most impressive railway action spectacle since Paddington 2 with an overly talky plot twist reveal wasn’t a great idea), but Neeson holds the film together with ease, despite knowing how to do this sort of thing in his sleep by now.

Neeson hinted late last year that he may have put away his bare-knuckle-brawling, family-saving ways once and for all, partially inspired by the fact that he is now older than Charles Bronson was when he was playing vengeful geriatrics in the Death Wish franchise. For now, he represents propulsive, high-concept silliness at its most reliably exciting. It’ll be a sad day when his action retirement inevitably arrives.

 3.5/5,,Daniel M. Kimmel," January 18, 2018","FILM REVIEW C THE COMMUTER. With Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill. Written by Byron Willinger & Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Rated PG-13 for some intense action/violence, and language. 104 minutes.

thecommuternewpostermainbig5992Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) is not having a good day. An ex-cop who has been selling life insurance, he lost most of his savings in the 2008 crash, he’s got a son going off to college, and C at age 60 C he’s just lost his job. Not your typical action hero by any means, but someone all-too-familiar in the real world. Things are about to get a lot worse.

The premise of THE COMMUTER is preposterous, but no more so than “Speed” (1994) or “Phone Booth” (2002). On the train home, Michael encounters a woman who calls herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga) and who strikes up a conversation with him, echoing the Alfred Hitchcock classic “Strangers on a Train” (1951). She offers him the chance to make a $100,000 by locating someone named “Prynne” who is on the train, and placing a tracking device in the bag the person is carrying. The only thing he’s told is that the person is not a regular on the train. Oh, and if he wants to see his wife and son alive he’ll do as he’s told.

He tries to notify the police, but Joanna seems to be one step ahead of him, telling him that he’s the one responsible for the bodies that start piling up. It’s a convoluted plot, to be sure, and you just have to go with the flow and not question exactly how Joanna knows what he’s up to even though she’s no longer on the train. That she’s not working alone is obvious, but it would take an evil genius to manipulate things as she does here.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra, in his fourth outing with Neeson (after “Unknown,” “Non-Stop,” and “Run All Night”) is adept at keeping things moving so quickly that you don’t have time to question the proceedings. When Michael discovers a body hidden beneath the floorboards, it leads to him ending up outside the moving train and having to get back in. It’s a bravura action sequence where it’s unlikely you’ll find yourself wondering how a 60-year-old insurance salesman has both the mental and physical capacity not to end up torn to pieces.

The film is really all Neeson, but he is surrounded with a solid cast including Jonathan Banks (“Breaking Bad”) as a fellow commuter, Patrick Wilson as his ex-partner, and Sam Neill as the too-slick police captain who has an unspoken history with Michael. Suffice to say there are red herrings galore, with plenty of suspects including an obnoxious broker with Goldman Sachs (Shazad Latif) who provokes the most populist line in the movie.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about “The Commuter” is that Neeson, who is actually 65, started out as a serious actor and now has a wide range of roles from drama to comedy to voiceover work to action star. For aging Baby Boomers, Neeson is an inspiration. It’s never too late to branch out, even if it means hanging from the side of a train.???"
 3/5,,Jim Lane," January 18, 2018",
,,M. Faust," January 18, 2018","As a dramatic location, you can’t beat a newspaper office in the pre-computer era. If anyone ever makes a movie set in the offices of a major newspaper in 2017, they won’t need a tracking camera to follow editors around the offices as they interrupt reporters furiously banging on manual typewriters. Nor will that movie have the benefit of giant clanking presses to visualize the importance of it all.

The Post is set in 1971, and it takes advantage of all that stuff. But Steven Spielberg’s movie, which tells the story of the Washington Post’s struggles to publish the top-secret Pentagon Papers, is no more about Nixon era politics than The Crucible was about the Salem with trials. Rushed into production earlier this year, The Post is clearly about the need for a free press to stand up against the lies that fuel Trumpism.

Which is not to say that it isn’t a canny piece of dramatic entertainment. Tom Hanks may not be able to get into a character as complex as Post editor Ben Bradlee, but he isn’t really called to, and he’s just fine at rousing bluster. Similarly, the Katherine Graham that Meryl Streep is asked to play is probably more cowering and timorous than the real lady who became publisher of the paper after the death of her husband, but that makes it all the more inspiring when she stands up to the personal and financial advisors who want her not to rock the boat. (Several scenes of women lining up to see Graham in public places have clearly chosen appealing to a contemporary audience over verisimilitude.) The real acting comes from a less expected role, Bob Odenkirk’s portrayal of reporter Ben Bagdikian, who was instrumental in getting a hard copy of the papers after the New York Times was enjoined by Nixon from publishing them.

Enjoyable as it is, The Post may not meet the measure of success that Spielberg probably wants: Will it inspire Americans to remember our real values, or will it only preach to the choir? Bradlee’s earnest plea that “The way they lied―those days have to be over. We have to hold them accountable. If we don’t, who will?” may, in the long run, be seen with bitter irony as a cri de coeur for a battle that was lost years ago.

On the topic of films that are not what they may appear to be, don’t be fooled into thinking that Paddington 2 is a children’s movie. That’s not to say that it isn’t appropriate for kids, and if you are tasked with the care of any by all means take them to see these newest adventures of the “short but polite” talking bear, as good a role model as you could ask for. But it takes an adult to truly appreciate Paddington’s good nature, so lacking everywhere you turn. (The trailers for two upcoming animated movies, filled with fart and ass jokes, that opened the show drove this point home.) Likewise, kids are unlikely to derive full pleasure from such sights as the Downton Abbey’s Earl of Grantham, a.k.a. Hugh Bonneville, doing yoga splits, or Dr. Who (Peter Capaldi) as a neighborhood crank, or The IT Crowd’s Richard Ayoade as a forensic investigator. (Director Michael Bond is best known for the cult comedy show The Mighty Boosh, so it’s no surprise that this is a bottomless font for Anglophiles.) Best of all is Hugh Grant as a villainous ham actor who gets to dress up in any number of ridiculous costumes before ending the film with a production number that only Mel Brooks has ever matched.

Still, perhaps you are not the sort of viewer who appreciates a film in which people blurt dialogue like, “I have just been spilled upon by chilled liquid!” In that case, you may find The Commuter more to your liking. The latest of Liam Neeson’s roles as a kickass action star (surely the most unexpected career shift in acting history since Leslie Nielsen turned to comedy) reunites him with director Jaume Collet-Serra, who has made better-than-average use of Neeson in films like Unknown, Ride All Night, and Non-Stop. Like that last one, which was set on an airplane in flight, The Commuter takes place almost entirely on an evening train out of Manhattan to the suburbs. Neeson’s character is again tasked with a mystery to be solved before it reaches its destination, about which the less said the better. It’s not as well-tooled as Non-Stop, and if I hesitate to lay out the mechanism of the plot it’s partly because discovering it in the movie is better than how it plays out. (I had a lot of “But what about…” questions on my way out of the theater.) The proceedings have just enough action to keep you awake without making you feel bludgeoned, if not quite enough plot to make you feel that it was worth all the build up.

You may suspect that any film called This Giant Papier-M?ché Boulder Is Actually Really Heavy is unlikely to be as interesting as its title. That depends on how much of a fan you are of cheesy old science fiction movies, or of Star Wars. Made in New Zealand on a budget that probably went entirely to film editing software, this comedy takes a trio of geeks at a sci-fi convention into the movie they’re watching. Literally. Writer-director Christian Nicolson, who also had to become the film’s star when his actor quit at the last minute, clearly spent as much of his youth watching Monty Python as he did Flash Gordon and The Giant Gila Monster. He cheerfully turns his shortcomings into an advantage, or at least a joke, and if it gets tiresome along the way rouses itself for a likeable ending. Those who check it out at the Screening Room this week may bear in mind that making no-budget genre spoofs in New Zealand was exactly how Peter Jackson got started."
,"Crítica de ""El pasajero"": Tren rigurosamente vigilado",Gaspar Zimerman," January 18, 2018","Esta es la cuarta película de acción dirigida por Jaume Collet-Serra y protagonizada por Liam Neeson, después de Sin identidad, Non-stop: Sin escalas y Desconocido (si no recuerda ninguna, es porque son todas tan entretenidas como olvidables). Es decir que conocen el producto que tienen entre manos. Por eso van al grano: enseguida tenemos al hombre común metido hasta el cuello en una situación extraordinaria, en un clima de tensión que recién decaerá poco antes del final.

Un gran montaje inicial -lo mejor de la película- nos presenta al héroe, su familia y su rutinaria vida, hasta que llega el día diferente. Y no por lo bueno: a Michael MacCauley lo echan del trabajo. Pero en el tren de regreso a su casa lo aborda una desconocida que le ofrece cien mil dólares a cambio de casi nada: debe localizar a cierto pasajero del tren. Sólo tiene dos pistas: el alias del sujeto y el dato de que lleva un bolso consigo.

A partir de ahí, no hay tiempos muertos: todo es frenético y atrapante. Está bien aprovechado el atractivo de un tren -del que el protagonista no se puede bajar- como único escenario de la acción. Una suerte de Asesinato en el Orient Express -cada pasajero con sus características distintivas, entre los que hay que descubrir al buscado- acelerado al ritmo de Máxima velocidad y siguiendo la matriz de Duro de matar.

Claro que para disfrutar de este cóctel explosivo hay que hacer un ejercicio de suspensión de la incredulidad. Porque si se piensa el argumento dos veces, enseguida aparecerán agujeros, y porque a los 65 a?os (aunque el personaje acusa 60), Neeson ya empieza a estar un poco grande para trompearse de igual a igual con purretes. También hay que pasar por alto la pirotecnia visual del último tramo, que sobra, es más ridícula que impactante y parece salida de otra película, aunque no llega a arruinar este aceptable producto."
 2.5/4,[Crítica] “El pasajero”: Liam Neeson salva el día,Sebastian Zavala Kahn," January 18, 2018","en los últimos a?os, Liam Neeson ha encontrado un nicho, y lo ha sabido aprovechar muy bien. Todo comenzó con el estreno de “Taken”, un filme de acción en el que el usualmente calmado Neeson asesina a un grupo de traficantes de mujeres, él solo. La película fue tal éxito, que las secuelas no se hicieron esperar; pero más importante, Neeson se dio cuenta de que podía seguir haciendo este tipo de filmes, combinándolos con sus proyectos más serios o dramáticos, para revivir ―o más bien, revitalizar― su carrera.

Fue así que su surgió su relación con el director barcelonés Jaume Collet-Serra, lo cual ha resultado en cuatro thrillers de acción de variada calidad. “El pasajero” es su más reciente esfuerzo, y si debemos creerle a Neeson, el último. Después de todo, el irlandés actor ya tiene más de 60 a?os, y cada vez se está haciendo más difícil de creer que es capaz de romperle los huesos a secuaces y villanos de menor edad. Al menos en “El pasajero” su avanzada edad es parte importante de la trama; no podían seguir fingiendo que no se está acercando a la tercera edad.

De hecho, ese es uno de los puntos fuertes de “El pasajero”: a diferencia de los thrillers anteriores de Collet-Serra y Neeson, el protagonista no es un héroe de acción invencible y todo poderoso. El Michael MacCauley de Neeson es un poco más frágil que sus personajes previos, lo cual hace que las secuencias de acción sea más tensas y verosímiles. Esto no quiere decir que nuestro protagonista no sea parte de escenas exageradas o de acrobacias que pondrían nervioso al más experimentado doble de acción; la diferencia es que estos momentos son menos frecuentes en “El pasajero” que en películas anteriores.

El filme comienza con un notable montaje que muestra la monotonía que define el día a día de MacCauley: todos los días se levanta con una alarma, toma desayuno con su esposa, Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) y su hijo adolescente, va al trabajo ―es vendedor de seguros― en tren, hace lo que tiene que hacer, y regresa a casa en el mismo modo de transporte. Parece tener una vida feliz, pero las cosas están complicadas; su hijo está a punto de entrar a la universidad, y les está faltando plata para poder pagar el ingreso y las mensualidades. Las cosas no mejoran, además, cuando Michael es despedido repentinamente, solo cinco a?os antes de su retiro.

Deprimido, antes de regresar a casa durante el día de su despido, Michael para en un bar, donde se encuentra con su ex compa?ero, Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) y un capitán de policía, Hawthorne (Sam Neill). No se preocupen, como ambos personajes son interpretados por actores conocidos, es obvio que sus roles serán más importantes de lo que parecen. Una vez que decide regresar a casa por tren, Michael se encuentra con una misteriosa mujer (Vera Farmiga), quien le ofrece un trato: le dará $100,000 dólares si es que encuentra a la persona que están buscando, y le pone un rastreador GPS. Michael no está seguro si hacerle caso, pero la situación se complica cuando amenazan a su familia, y sus nuevos enemigos demuestran que son capaces de todo ―hasta matar― para convencerlo de cumplir su “misión”.

“El pasajero” es un thriller simple, lleno de huecos narrativos, pero en general, entretenido. Es el tipo de película que Hitchcock hubiese aprovechado de mejor manera ―lógicamente― pero que el cumplidor Collet-Serra claramente se divierte en desarrollar. La cinta funciona “en el momento”; uno se cree la mayoría de eventos que se desarrollan ―desde las secuencias de acción hasta los giros narrativos repentinos―, pero una vez que los analiza al salir de la sala de cine, queda claro que no tienen demasiado sentido. El filme se mueve a buen ritmo, y inyecta suficientes momentos de tensión como para que uno se preocupe por la vida de Michael, su familia y, eventualmente, los pasajeros que lo acompa?an en el tren."
,The Commuter is the first great movie of 2018,Ben Sachs," January 18, 2018","The Commuter, which is now playing in general release, is top-shelf entertainment, with nail-biting suspense, captivating mystery, and loads of visual imagination. It confirms that Jaume Collet-Serra (Non-Stop, Run All Night, The Shallows) is one of the best genre directors working today. The film features one inspired set piece after another; Collet-Serra takes great pleasure in moviemaking, and his enjoyment is infectious. That the story is wildly implausible doesn’t detract from the immense satisfaction it has to offer. Rather, the narrative operates under a certain dream logic that’s wholly cinematic, and Collet-Serra delivers it with such emotional conviction that one gets absorbed regardless of the obvious plot holes. I’d be delighted if a more purely enjoyable movie gets released this year.

The Commuter is inspired from its very first sequence. Over the opening credits, Collet-Serra covers roughly a year in the life of Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson), an ex-cop turned insurance salesman. The filmmakers show his morning routine―waking up, having breakfast with his wife and teenage son, driving to the train station where he boards the commuter line to Manhattan―but with each cut, the story advances days or weeks into the future. It’s a clever way of showing how MacCauley’s routine remains basically the same even as little aspects of it change. In one particularly affecting passage, Collet-Serra and editor Nicolas De Toth cut between several mornings at the train station before MacCauley’s wife (Elizabeth McGovern) drops him off. One morning they laugh together, the next they argue, then they appear cool toward each other, and finally they express affection again. By the end of the sequence, one recognizes the ebb and flow of their marriage and the daily comforts that hold it together.

Within minutes, however, the characters’ stable life is disrupted. After meeting with a young couple at his office―where MacCauley shares the story of how he and his wife lost their savings after the financial crisis of 2008―our hero gets laid off from his job. The economical narrative has already established that MacCauley has nothing to fall back on, and so one instantly shares in his devastation at the bad news. Neeson plays the 60-year-old everyman perfectly, conveying with carefully chosen gestures the character’s vulnerability and shame. Too embarrassed to call his wife and tell her what’s happened, MacCauley goes to a bar and commiserates with his old partner from the police force (Patrick Wilson), who reassures him that he still has a loving family at home.

And then things get odd. Riding the train back from the city, MacCauley meets a strange woman (Vera Farmiga) who makes him a peculiar offer. Will he locate someone on the train who’s getting off at the end of the line and plant a tracking device on his or her bag? If he does, he’ll get $100,000 in cash. Farmiga (who delivers an alluringly opaque performance) doesn’t divulge why this person needs to be tracked, but the implications seem sinister. Is the promise of the cash reward enough to make MacCauley overlook the dark mystery of the task? He certainly needs the money, and it shouldn’t be too difficult to deduce which person he needs to find. MacCauley accepts, albeit reluctantly; when he considers changing his mind, he learns that Farmiga’s character―apparently part of some shadowy cabal―will have his wife and son killed if he doesn’t carry out the job. Not only that, there are people on the train who are watching him to make sure he follows orders.

The Commuter

    The Commuter

Collet-Serra makes the most of this Hitchcockian set-up, creating simmering suspense with virtually every shot. Each stranger on the train has the potential to be either MacCauley's target or a murderous spy, and MacCauley has only so much time to figure out who’s who. There are times when his enemies reveal themselves to him, and these moments make for some of The Commuter’s most exciting passages. Several deadly fights take place on board the train, and Collet-Serra stages each one differently, finding new ways to frame and stage action within a relatively limited space. One fight transpires in a remarkable long-take that comprises the most impressive single shot I’ve seen in quite a while: the camera moves gracefully and constantly reframes the action as MacCauley and his opponent vie for the upper hand. At other times, Collet-Serra and De Toth build suspense through rapid―but never disorienting―cuts, as in a passage where MacCauley, having briefly gotten off the train, struggles to get back on while the vehicle gains speed.

Sequences like these showcase the director’s talent for presenting confinement in a cinematic manner. In fact most of Collet-Serra’s recent work is defined by confinement, with characters trapped in life-or-death struggles in tight locations or within brief windows of time. He seems to thrive on the challenge of creating multiple approaches to limited spaces―the aesthetic challenge mirrors the challenges in which his characters find themselves. Yet his work isn’t satisfying merely on a formal level. Throughout his movies, one experiences deep sympathy for the hero and minor characters alike. The Commuter is no exception; many of the various regulars on the train make strong impressions, and later in the story, when MacCauley forms alliances with the other passengers, the film turns rousingly optimistic. The good cheer with which Collet-Serra defines the supporting players ameliorates The Commuter’s nightmarish premise and draws viewers deeper into its spell."
 3/5,,Rob Carnevale," January 18, 2018","LIAM Neeson’s fourth outing with writer-director Jaume Collet-Serra is a trashy, enjoyable B-movie that succeeds in spite of its own absurdity.

Part Hitchcock thriller, part Die Hard/Under Siege actioner and part Collet-Sera’s own Non-Stop, The Commuter is the type of fast-moving thrill-ride that Hollywood doesn’t really make anymore C which only adds to its appeal.

Neeson plays insurance salesman Michael, a former cop (aka a person with a special set of skills), whose bad day becomes infinitely worse while, during his evening commute home, he is approached by a mysterious stranger (played by Vera Farmiga) on the train and given an interesting proposition.

If he can uncover the identity of a hidden passenger before the last stop, he will be in line to receive a hefty reward. But as he works against the clock to solve the puzzle, he realises he is a pawn in a wider conspiracy that has put the lives of the hidden passenger and his own family in peril… not to mention the remaining passengers on the train.

Interesting Hitchcock-inspired set-up aside, The Commuter works best if you’re willing to just go with it. If not, then you’ll quickly realise how little sense it makes.

The various elements of the conspiracy and how they come together seldom add up, while Neeson’s own death-defying exploits (at his character’s age of 60, no less) increasingly strain credibility.

Yet in spite of its obvious failings, The Commuter rattles along in such a ridiculously enjoyable manner that you may well be having too much fun to notice. What’s more, it boasts a top-drawer ensemble cast, who work overtime to cover up those plot-holes.

Neeson is as reliable as ever, looking buff, yet imbuing his character with an everyman likeability that serves him well during his more OTT moments. Farmiga is suitably enticing and mysterious, while the likes of Patrick Wilson (as an ex-partner) and Jonathan Banks, Roland Moller, Colin McFarlane and Clara Lago all make intriguing C if under-developed C fellow passengers and/or train crew.

Collet-Sera keeps the identity of the secret passenger well concealed and has fun placing Neeson’s character in do-or-die situations from which there seems little chance of scape, thereby ramping up the tension. While his keen eye for a set-piece ensures that there is some suitably big-screen carnage that carries a very real wow factor, not to mention several bruising fights between Neeson and various foes.

If The Commuter does, ultimately, derail itself, it’s in that wafer-thin character-building of its peripheral characters, some of its more wayward plotting and an ending that feels way too contrived. It could really have been elevated by a Hitchcock-style twist of its own.

But as an alternative to the more weighty films doing the rounds in search of awards recognition this time of year, The Commuter is an absurdly enjoyable popcorn romp that engages for anyone willing to keep their brain in neutral."
 3/5,The Commuter review - trouble on the main line,Adam Sweeting," January 18, 2018","Nobody is more sensitive about the notion of becoming a geriatric action hero than Liam Neeson (“guys, I’m sixty-fucking-five,” as he points out), but he can still punch bad guys and leap off moving trains with the best of ‘em. In this latest battle against the odds while the clock ticks down, Neeson is insurance salesman Michael McCauley, who commutes into Manhattan every day. Except he won’t any more, because he just got sacked.

Before this calamity befalls him, director Jaume Collet-Sera (who also collaborated with Neeson on Run All Night, Unknown and Non-Stop) has some fun with the daily grind of the New York wage slave. There’s a comical montage of breakfast scenes in the McCauley household, as Michael and wife Karen (Elizabeth “Downton” McGovern) get the family fed and watered and dad off to his train on the Hudson line, with the protagonists giving fast flashes of happy, sad, funny or angry depending on their mood or the weather. The train journey itself is depicted as a kind of drowsy mosaic of overheard fragments of conversation and a motley cast of characters including bankers, punks and eccentric railway staff, and like as not the air conditioning has broken down.

It’s when McCauley is still reeling from the news that he’s now an ex-employee of UCI Insurance (“sometimes soldiers end up casualties”, his boss has told him helpfully) and wondering how to tell his wife that he’s approached on the train by a mysterious woman called Joanna (Vera Farmiga, pictured right, wearing enigmatically stripey shoes). “It’s my first time on a commuter train,” she tells him, which is hardly the most convincing opening line. But she has a proposition for him: there’s somebody on the train who “doesn’t belong”, and if he can identify this individual before the train reaches Cold Spring station, he’ll earn himself $100,000. Quite an attractive offer for a man with lots of financial commitments and no job, especially as he’s an ex-cop with detection skills.

McCauley agonises for a bit, but when he takes the $25k down payment he finds himself trapped on a one-way ride which means he either completes his mission or his family and lots of innocent people will die. Joanna keeps barking orders at him down the phone, and she and her unseen co-conspirators have a remarkable ability to control space and time. For instance, when the train’s in a station she tells McCauley to look out of the window, just in time to see one of his travelling buddies run down by a car C this is what happens when he doesn’t play ball, and will doubtless be the fate of his target (who's called Prynne). It seems not even McCauley’s old police partner Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson) can help him.As McCauley frantically tries every trick to find the mystery passenger, the tension cranks up as time runs out, and Collet-Sera skilfully exploits angles and perspectives to turn the train into a queasy mobile labyrinth. In the process The Commuter shamelessly helps itself to bits of other movies like Speed or Source Code (there’s even a cheeky steal from Spartacus) and the adrenalin keeps pumping nicely right up to a spectacularly aerobatic rail crash. There’s a guest spot for Jonathan Banks, playing a veteran passenger called Walt who’s more or less indistinguishable from Banks’s Mike Ehrmantraut in Better Call Saul, while Shazad Latif plays Vince, an obnoxious Goldman Sachs banker permanently conducting bombastic phone conversations. McCauley gives Vince a message from the sponsors: “On behalf of the American middle class, fuck you.”

It’s formulaic and you can probably guess the ending, but it’s a pacy, enjoyable thriller capable of laughing at itself. Neeson, who does a fine job here as an essentially decent man trying to do his best under ludicrous pressure, needn’t fret about getting called up for the Expendables just yet."
 7/10,The Commuter Review: Liam Neeson’s latest is a flashy and fun ride,Nathanael Hood," January 17, 2018","]There comes a moment in Jaume Collet-Serra’s The Commuter where all one’s problems with the film―all one’s disbelief towards its improbable premise, all one’s discomfort with its occasionally shoddy camerawork and editing―fall away. In this moment we realize our total investment in its story, in its characters, in its simple progression of set-pieces. In recent years Collet-Serra has quietly established himself as an unsung craftsman of tightly knit, expertly executed genre pictures that keep slipping under the mainstream radar despite reliable critical and commercial success, most notably 2016’s delightful surfer-vs-shark thriller The Shallows. But in The Commuter we see a new fine-tuning of his talents in one of the first true surprises of 2018.

While on his evening train commute home from New York City, mild-mannered insurance salesman and ex-cop Michael McCauley (Liam Neeson) is approached by a mysterious woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga) who offers him $100,000 to take part in a mysterious challenge. Somewhere on the train is a passenger who doesn’t belong. On the passenger is a bag. Find the passenger, mark the bag, and do it all before they get off at the last stop. Oh, and if he doesn’t, his wife and daughter will die. She will be watching. Her employers will be watching. Behave and play the game or else.

With its simple, high-concept plot revolving around a meeting of literal strangers on a train, comparisons between The Commuter and Alfred Hitchcock seem inevitable. But a more accurate comparison would be with Agatha Christie, particularly her beloved (and recently adapted) novel Murder on the Orient Express. But whereas that book focuses on a detective solving a murder while trapped on a train, this film follows a detective trying to prevent a murder while trapped on a train. Having taken the same train to and from work for ten years, he knows all the regular passengers. Through some clever deductions involving the ticket stubs of riders he doesn’t recognize, he identifies a number of possible targets: an exhausted Latina nurse, a punk rock photography student, an arrogant broker, a black guitar player, a bald card shark, and a tattooed thug. Logically one of them must not be who they say they are. Before long McCauley figures out he’s been drafted into identifying the sole witness in a murder case involving a city planner so they can be assassinated by Joanna’s employers. This means two passengers are suspect: a witness and an assassin.

One of the joys of The Commuter is how it establishes the train itself as a consistent physical space. Each compartment has its specific passengers, its specific rail employees, its specific landmarks. One of the compartments has even been abandoned due to a broken A/C generator, giving Collet-Serra the perfect setting for tense confrontations between McCauley and the passengers as well as threatening phone calls from the seemingly omnipresent Joanna. The train becomes almost a character itself, one we get to know intimately as McCauley traverses throughout, outside, and even beneath it in his desperate hunt.

Neeson may be in his mid-sixties, but Collet-Serra manages to pull many demanding stunts from this grizzled genre veteran. In the last few years Neeson has become a constant fixture in rushed-out January-February action films. But while the other ones might have bigger effects budgets and fight scenes, none of them have felt so visceral and desperate as the ones captured here. One scene where Neeson has to role himself out from under a set of tracks as the train runs above him actually yanked an audible yelp from me. One fistfight with a passenger involving impromptu melee weapons would have ranked among the best fight scenes I’ve seen in some months if it hadn’t been shot largely in medium-close-up with shaky cams.

The third act eventually settles into traditional action beats involving an obnoxiously animated CGI train derailment (relax, it’s in the trailer), a tense hostage situation, and shocking betrayals involving people we thought were clean but were really on the take and vice versa. But the meat of the movie is in its first two acts where it’s just a man trying to get to the bottom of a desperate situation with nothing but his guts, brains, and instincts. It’s a film that presumes an active, engaged audience eager to use their brains, not turn them off. It might be a flashy piece of entertainment, but it’s not a stupid one."
 3/5,Review: ‘The Commuter’ Hits the Sweet Spot Where Art Meets Trash,Tony Stamp," January 17, 2018","Jaume Collet-Serra has a flair for the absurd. His films hit that sweet spot where art meets trash, going right up to the line of implausibility then cheerfully sailing over it. They’re wildly entertaining, and Collet-Serra is no hack C his films are well made, he just has no interest in restraint or realism.

The Commuter is the Spanish director’s fourth team up with Liam Neeson, after the amnesia mystery Unknown, plane-based whodunit Non-Stop and disappointing NYC thriller Run All Night. It’s the pair’s most successful outing, despite basically sharing a plot with Non-Stop. Just, on a train this time.

Once again Neeson is at the whim of a mysterious stranger on the other end of a phone (this time we know it’s Vera Farmiga right off the bat). Tasked with finding a certain passenger without knowing their appearance, Neeson ambles up and down the carriages like an especially rumpled Poirot. Conveniently, he turns out to be an ex-cop.

The mystery is good enough. Collet-Serra is a student of Hitchcock, and his visual nods to the British master are more than just window dressing.

He also orchestrates action scenes so ludicrous you expect him to lean into frame and wink at the audience. There are two showstoppers here, one an extended fight scene that emulates the long takes of The Raid and Atomic Blonde to great effect, another that leans heavily on CGI without turning into a complete pixelf*ck.

Most impressive is how engaging it all stays while remaining in one location. The camera pirouettes though the train as familiar actors act vaguely suspiciously, and before long they each fall under Neeson’s piercing gaze.

The Commuter doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it’s a solid enough thriller, as relentless as its sixty five-year-old lead actor and eager to entertain, logic be damned."
,,Al Hoff," January 17, 2018","In Jaume Collet-Serra’s absurd but relatively entertaining thriller, Liam Neeson plays an everyman ― a financially stressed family man who is just trying to get to his suburban home from Manhattan on the Metro North train. For reasons too dumb and complicated to explain here, he winds up spending the normally uneventful journey variously interrogating, punching and rescuing his fellow passengers. It gives Neeson plenty of time to roam the cars, sorting out red herrings, while also worrying about his wife and his 401(k); first he’s panicked, then he’s out for justice! He may be a mild-mannered insurance man, but don’t count him out when it comes time to jump train cars. The first half of the film is better than the second ― it sets up a recognizable character and lets him work through a moral quandary. Then it’s Neeson Action Time, and a series of increasingly ridiculous set-ups and easily guessed plot feints. It’s also about 15 minutes too long, but not bad for a cold winter night, if you like to see Neeson get shit done.  "

LIONSGATE

An action movie, a phone, Liam Neeson - you know what's coming.

However, tonight's trip on the Hudson North Line is anything but usual. He's approached by a stripy-shoed woman who calls herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga) and claims to be a psychologist.

She puts a ""hypothetical scenario"" to him. There's a package in one of the train's toilets which contains $25,000, which would be offered for something C you guessed it Taken fans C that Martin is ""uniquely qualified"" to do.

""Someone who does not belong on this train has stolen something,"" Joanna informs him, adding that in order to qualify for the cash and an additional $75,000 they would have to figure out who this is and place a GPS on their bag.

Naturally, curiousity gets the better of him, but when he then immediately tries to back out, Martin receives a package at the next stop C his wife's wedding ring.

Same schtick, different day? Well yes, it's hard not to see the similarities between this, the Taken films and the earlier Neeson-Collet-Serra team-ups.

The Commuter once again has the one-time Quin-Gon Jinn dishing out justice, taking names and yelling down the phone. And yet despite seemingly cribbing from a plethora of 1980s and '90s action movies C everything from Die Hard, Speed and In the Line of Fire to Commando, Enemy of the State and The Fugitive, as well as the wholesale theft of a classic Hollywood finale, there's a surprising amount of fun to be had.

Liam Neeson discusses The Commuter.

Spanish helmer Collet-Serra keeps the action, twists and conspiracy coming thick and fast, while also throwing in some artful editing and genuine jumps. As for Neeson, there's just something appealing about watching the Ballymena brawler rail against corruption, the cabal du jour and time itself."
 3/5,,Larushka Ivan-Zadeh," January 17, 2018","RIVALLING The Accountant as the least electrifying action-man moniker ever, The Commuter reunites Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra with the same preposterously entertaining results.

Newly redundant from the insurance firm where he’s toiled for 20 years, a salesman (Neeson) boards his usual train back home ― with unusual results. A slinky blonde stranger (Vera Farmiga) offers him $100,000 if he will point out the person ‘who does not belong’ on the train. If he doesn’t, there will be consequences. With fishy-looking types at every turn, it’s like a high-speed Murder On The Orient Express with more face punching. The story’s total nonsense yet utterly compelling, and guaranteed to slap a smile on your face, if possibly for the wrong reasons. "
 2.5/5,We're sorry to announce The Commuter isn't a Liam Neeson's classic,Harry Guerin," January 17, 2018","Four months on from telling journalists that, at 65, he was a geriatric for the genre, the Free Travel-approaching Neeson acquits himself with goer gusto in The Commuter. It's his fourth film with director Jaume Collet-Serra after Unknown, Non-Stop and Run All Night, and while he keeps his side of the beat-em-up bargain, he deserved a better vehicle for his talents than this train-set thriller.
Strangers on a train...

Playing like Rebirth of a Salesman, The Commuter sees Neeson's insurance hawker arriving at the stop named P45 and then getting an offer he can't refuse from another passenger (Vera Farmiga - underused like Elizabeth McGovern and Sam Neill) on the train back home. Every man, as they say, has his thumbscrew, and Farmiga's mystery woman twists good-o in this movie, a whoisit rather than a whodunit.
The offer he can't refuse...

The first half is great fun, with Neeson gravelling and growling his way through every line as only he can. Yes, he's on the phone; yes, he looks great with a manbag and yes, it's not long before his crisp Oxford is only fit for the bin. In a nice bit of Die Irish casting, Killian Scott is among those to receive a larruping. Reckon he's still sounding the reverse alarm whenever he goes to sit in a chair...
Liam Neeson and Killian Scott get to grips with their scene

But for all the style and slickness, The Commuter literally goes off the rails and ends up feeling too close to the man-in-a-box trip we took aboard Non-Stop's doomed Transatlantic flight. Like that movie, the CGI during the big finale is silly. 
Yes, he's on the phone; yes, he looks great with a manbag and yes, it's not long before his crisp Oxford is only fit for the bin

Neeson and Collet-Serra are planning a fifth film together. After this, they need to make sure we're all in first class."
 2/5,,Nigel Andrews," January 17, 2018",
 4/5,,Elena Lazic," January 17, 2018","Self-aware superhero blockbusters are all but dominating Hollywood action cinema. Meanwhile, mid-budget, cheesy and self-serious action films, of the variety which made the 1990s so much fun, have barely space to breathe. Success stories such as the John Wick films have hinted at a desire for old school, concept and character-driven action stories, but even those movies have been a little too knowing to truly recall the cream of that bygone era.

Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra has made his name as a modest master of these boilerplate genre flicks, and in turn has come closest to reviving this dearly missed tradition. He made waves with the ludicrous and brilliant 2016 film The Shallows, in which Blake Lively goes head-to-head with a shark. He impresses again with his new one, The Commuter, the most fully realised and rewarding of his collaborations with star Liam Neeson (Unknown, Non-Stop, Run All Night).

In this tight, fun and astonishingly choreographed new work, Collet-Serra once more demonstrates an intuitive understanding of his star’s image as a decent man who will always play by the rules C until someone else breaks them and attacks his family. He plays Michael Woolrich, a married man in his sixties who has worked, for most of his life, at an insurance company. On the cusp of sending his son to an expensive university, he is unexpectedly laid off. Seeing a star like Neeson troubled with such mundane problems is already thrilling in and of itself, but the story does not stop there.

Aboard the commuter train Woolrich has taken every day for the past 20 years, a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) approaches him and offers him a chance to make a lot of money in return for doing one simple task which would mean nothing to him, but a lot for somebody else. This straightforward metaphor for ruthless capitalism turns even more bizarre when our hero refuses to obey: the woman then holds his family hostage and threatens to kill everyone on the train if he doesn’t follow her orders. Caught up in a criminal conspiracy, he is forced to do what she asks: find the commuter she is looking for, and whack them.

Nodding to Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’, the film follows Neeson as he trudges from carriage to carriage, investigating an eclectic ensemble of characters and pointing out the faces he does not recognise. The comparison becomes beautifully obvious when the driver is killed. As the train nears its destination, the stakes amp up, and the strange woman becomes more impatient. The film itself also becomes less and less realistic. In its most audacious and, eventually, explosive moments, the film directly references both Tony Scott’s wonderful Unstoppable and Jan de Bont’s classic adrenaline rush, Speed.

The Commuter would not be half as much fun if it explicitly pointed out those references or acknowledged its own ridiculousness, in the manner of other contemporary, self-aware Hollywood action movies. This surface seriousness, and a refusal to fall into postmodern line, make it a film that functions as a latter-day continuation of ’90s action movies, rather than an homage to them. It is never afraid of being fun."
 3/5,,David Hughes," January 17, 2018","Liam Neeson has a very particular set of skills, skills he has acquired over a very long career. Which other actor boasts a CV that includes a Star Wars, a Batman, three Narnias, Love Actually, a Lego Movie and an Oscar nomination, and packs enough box-office muscle to turn a turkey like Taken into a trilogy?

Between franchises, there have been peaks (The Grey, A Walk Among The Tombstones) and deep, deep troughs (Battleship, Taken 2 and 3), but if you liked Neeson in director Collet-Serra’s vertiginously high-concept thrillers Unknown (nobody recognises our Liam!), Non-Stop (there’s a killer on Liam’s plane!), and Run All Night (he's got a single night to save his son!), you’ll be pleased to hear that their fourth collaboration is their best yet. If you didn’t, you’ll know that’s damning with faint praise.

    Neeson is at his most relatable. 

Neeson certainly has the chops to pull off a Hitchcockian thriller, so it’s a pity Collet-Serra doesn’t, because The Commuter gives them one hell of a plot C find the stranger on a train C coupled with an almost real-time race against the clock device Hitch would have straight up killed for. No, it doesn’t make a lick of sense C the logic bombs start exploding before the train leaves the station C but Neeson makes for an engaging everyman-in-peril, and is at his most relatable as the newly unemployed insurance salesman having a bad day take a turn for the worse.

Supporting cast-wise, it’s no Murder On The Orient Express, but it’s good to have Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson (who, after this and The A-Team, Liam really needs to stop trusting), Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill and Elizabeth McGovern along for the ride. En route, a succession of increasingly implausible plot twists ratchet up the tension, Neeson gets to throw some punches, Brian Mills-style (he’s ex-NYPD, remember), and by the time the train, and the film, go off the rails in spectacular fashion, you’ll probably be having too much fun to care."

 5/10,,Benjam??n Harguindey," January 16, 2018","Liam Neeson interpreta a un vendedor de seguros que es despedido súbitamente y en el tren de regreso a casa una femme fatale (Vera Farmiga) le propone un sencillo trato: que identifique a un intruso a bordo del tren a cambio de cien mil dólares. ?Por qué él? Además de ser ex vendedor es ex policía, y supuestamente conoce al tren y a sus pasajeros como la palma de su mano.

La estrella y los avances comerciales sugieren una película de acción. En realidad El pasajero es un thriller, en síntesis no tan distinto a Asesinato en el Orient Express (Murder on the Orient Express, 2017). Estructuralmente es la misma trama: un detective a bordo de un tren en el que todos parecen sospechosos y uno por uno van siendo descartados. La diferencia clave es que en vez de identificar quién es el asesino el detective debe identificar quien será la víctima. Dicho esto Asesinato en el Orient Express es más exitosa en su acometido de evocar la nostalgia de un pasado glamoroso que El pasajero en sus intentos por retratar convincentemente el tedio y hartazgo de la clase trabajadora rumbo a casa.

?Es un buen thriller? Los enigmas son dos: quién es el intruso y quién se encuentra detrás de la conspiración. La respuesta a la segunda pregunta debería ser obvia teniendo en cuenta la vieja máxima acerca de los invitados estrella en los programas de televisión. La respuesta a la primera pregunta no es tan obvia, pero se debe a que no depende de ninguna de las soluciones presentadas al espectador, lo cual raya la trampa.

La trama se va descarrilando minuto a minuto, y los momentos de heroísmo social - sacados de cualquier película de desastres - son una mezcla de tiernos y vergonzosos. Pero por más predecible y ridícula que se ponga, la película no aburre. Neeson no se ve particularmente explotado como en las películas más rutinarias de su carrera y compone un protagonista creíble y entra?able, dentro de todo. La acción, compuesta con claridad a base de planos secuencia, es mucho más satisfactoria que la acostumbrada cámara temblorosa y montaje confuso. Hasta hay algún que otro buen chiste.

No hay grandes sorpresas ni momentos memorables en esta película, y como thriller es mediocre aún según los estándares de películas similares. Si resulta entretenido es gracias a su competente héroe de acción y la técnica del realizador Jaume Collet-Serra, que aún dentro del género es capaz de mejores resultados. Una noche para sobrevivir (Run All Night, 2015) tenía todo lo que El pasajero y además personajes interesantes y un conflicto humano genuinamente dramático. Aquí el director se ha conformado con lo mínimo."
 5/10,,Tony Medley," January 16, 2018"," Every few years since Taken (2008) was a runaway hit 10 years ago, Liam Neeson has come out with a similar type thriller. He is always a man alone facing insurmountable odds. Each time the resulting film has been a little weaker than the one that came before. This one is simply preposterous.

Directed by Juame Collet-Serra from a script by Brien Willinger, Philip de Blasi, and Ryan Engle, they place Michael Macauley (Neeson) on a train where he is accosted by a beautiful woman, Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who manipulates him into trying to find somebody on the train before it gets to a certain stop. She then disappears.

What ensues is, basically, one ridiculous plot hole after another. But the biggest pothole is that the people behind this know every move Michael makes, or is going to make, before he makes it. They are in contact with him through cell phones, even though he doesn’t have a cell phone.

Omniscient as they seem, however, they know everything except the identity of the person he’s trying to find. It's straining credulity to the breaking point that these people could be so organized and knowledgeable, but wouldn't know who it was they are after. There is tension throughout as Michael tries to comply with the instructions and Neeson does a good job of reflecting the virtual impossibility of his dire situation. And there’s a lot of action. Unfortunately, almost every scene is inexplicable and devoid of common sense including the ending.

And, speaking of endings, it seems to me that it is time that Neeson puts an end to these woefully weak follow-ups to Taken, or find better material.

 "
 3/5,,Tim Brayton," January 15, 2018","It had seemed, for a little while there, that Liam Neeson had tired of the ""AARP action hero"" phase of his career: Run All Night, his third thriller with director Jaume Collet-Serra, came out early in 2015, and since then it's been nothing but respectable roles in respectable movies: a small but hugely critical part in Martin Scorsese's very methodical and grave Silence, a big mo-cap and vocal part in the the solemn A Monster Calls, and the lead in a political biopic about Mark ""Deep Throat"" Felt, which nobody in the world saw, but which I'm sure was very sober and historically neat. And he somehow ended up in a Korean action film called Operation Chromite playing Gen. Douglas MacArthur, which I suppose could go either way.

At any rate, the three-year drought ends here, with The Commuter, his fourth collaboration with Collet-Serra, and their second which drops Neeson's character on a tube-shaped mass-transit vehicle where Neeson has to solve a crime before the vehicle reaches its destination, and in the process makes it look like he's gone nuts and has taken all the other passengers hostage, and there is a shady, mysterious woman played by an actor way the fuck overqualified for such a tiny nothing role. The last one was Non-Stop, in 2014, and it was set on a plane. The Commuter is set on train headed north from Manhattan to the suburbs. And if I may say so, a plane is a better location for a thriller, yet The Commuter is the better film - probably the best of the Collet-Serra/Neeson ventures, even, though there is a pretty narrow range of quality between all of them.

The title clues us in to the variable that's being played with this time around: Neeson's character, ex-cop Michael MacCauley, is a working schlub, dragging himself ever day from his family's upper-middle class home in Tarrytown to the city, where he works in an impersonal glass skyscraper selling life insurance. In the film's one aesthetically distinctive gesture, the opening credits sequence sees his routine play out across dozens of little moments, fragmenting his morning into repetitive gestures (turn off the alarm clock, wake up his teenage son (Dean-Charles Chapman), chat with his wife (Elizabeth McGovern), ride with her to the train station), showing us that no matter what's going on any given morning (sometimes he interrupts his son in the middle of sexting, sometimes he and his wife are fighting, sometimes it's raining), Michael is basically a boring person with an unending, unsatisfying, but reliably static lifestyle. It says something, I think, that this is the film's one big stylistic extravagance, and also that it hasn't been done very well by the post-production team (the sound editing is a little bit off). And that's just fine: we do not go to films like The Commuter hoping to be dazzled, but instead to see how well the old formulas go this time.

Pretty well, is the answer. The real narrative starts out as a mystery and then turns into an action film, and it's a solid version of both. Michael, on the day he is unceremoniously fired, is offered $100,000 by a woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga, wasted in a grossly insufficient role even by Vera Farmiga standards). All he needs is to find somebody with a bag, who isn't a regular commuter on this line, getting off at Cold Spring. The name and sex of the somebody is unknown, though they are using the false name ""Prynne"", nor does Joanna know what the bag looks like. Michael is intrigued enough by the puzzle, and the $25,000 down payment, to start figuring out what's going on, prowling up and down the train, from end to end, several times, though he naturally assumes that Joanna is hiding something and is up to no good. Spoiler alert: she is, and she is. But as insurance, she's kidnapped Michael's family.

The Commuter adds no new wrinkles to what feels, overall, like an awfully familiar scenario; the shocking twists are pretty much exactly what they ought to be, and when we finally meet Prynne, their identity is no more nor less arbitrary than if they'd been any of the other half-dozen candidates Michael ineptly interrogates during his sweeps of the train. Oh well. Pity the viewer who enters this film for its story; the reasons to watch this are firstly, Neeson's unmatched ability to add a layer of sad humanity to the business of yelling and punching and hanging off the side of a train, and secondly, the ""bringing a pot to a boil"" gradualism with which the film cranks up the tension; this is in no small part because of Paul Cameron's cinematography, which closely attends to the sun lowering and setting over the course of the train ride, creating a deepening sense of gloom as well as providing the most subtle, subconscious kind of ticking clock. But it's also thanks to the ""and then there were none"" structure of Byron Willinger & Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle's screenplay, with every new dead end in Michael's investigation (coupled with a bit more of a disheveled look in Neeson's eyes, and tightness in his voice) ratcheting the tension up one more notch.

And of course, there are action scenes: fewer than one might have wanted or expected, but what's there is excellent (bar some lousy CGI in a big sequence near the end). One fight scene, in particular, makes especially excellent use of the layout of a passenger train to funnel the movement of the characters through the space, and provide them with objects to interact with and dodge around, and that's all I'll say about it; it's an excellent scene, though, and probably the worthiest reason to watch the film at all.

None of this is extraordinary or unexpected: even the emotional arc laced through the movie, hinging on Michael's sense of uselessness as a 60-year-old with rusty skills and no job, is kind of just the thing you get with Neeson action movies, and he's had better arcs. I'm also not terribly impressed with the film's noncommittal treatment of economic desperation: the MacCauleys are dead broke and barely able to afford college, and this is the fuel for everything else that follows, but it's more of a feint towards seriousness, discarded as soon as the film can move on to something splashier. And even when it's present, it's utterly artless, with scenes that all but ask Neeson to turn to the camera and mournfully intone, in his gravelly brogue, platitudes about the unfairness of the modern American economy that the film has no interest in developing beyond noting that bosses suck. If it is impressive at all, it's only because a film like this needs no thematic resonance at all, and when it has any, it seems smarter than it actually is. But that's fine too. The Commuter didn't need to be smart, didn't even need to pretend to be smart, and it's a taut enough thriller that whatever else is wrong with it (some messy handheld camerawork, too much editing, stereotypical characters), it's still a satisfying bit of boilerplate action cinema."

 2.5/4,"'The Commuter' review: Another preposterous, but watchable Liam Neeson thriller",John Serba," January 15, 2018","“The Commuter” is rooted in a thought experiment of sorts: A man is hard up for money. He’s offered a pile of cash to perform a task, harmless on its face, that will have consequences for another person. He does not know what those consequences are. Does he go through with it?

It’s a moral conundrum, and when you think about it, it boils down to whether the man can live with the mystery, never knowing the final chapter of the story, so to speak. Of course, the scenario has sinister overtones, with implied harm coming to the other person, because why else would a large sum of money be involved? The designer of this scheme would have to be an amoral psychotic.

In the case of this movie, Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) is the man, and he’s approached with the scenario by an unknown woman (Vera Farmiga). He’s tasked with identifying a person on a commuter train from New York City to the suburbs via a few vague characteristics, one of them being, the person “doesn’t belong.” Theoretically, he makes the commute every day, and will be able to narrow travelers down by their unfamiliar faces.

Of course, he’s also an ex-cop, presumably with some detective skills. Oh, and the ability to throw and/or take a punch, and shoot a gun. All of those abilities just might come in handy in a movie that’s rated PG-13 for “some intense action/violence,” but I’m no spoiler.

Also of course, the movie pairs Neeson with director Jaume Collet-Serra for the fourth time, after “Unknown,” “Non-Stop” and “Run All Night,” movies that absolutely weren’t resolved nonviolently, but are similarly contrived, Hitchcock-inspired suspense-thrillers with modest thematic ambitions and strong direction. Collet-Serra’s wily camera movements and inspired use of locations pair reasonably well with Neeson’s sincere approach to everyman action-hero characters, and it’s a functional formula for movies that amuse and divert with little pretention. 

It’s a no good, very bad day for Michael even before he gets on the train C he’s let go from his job as a life insurance salesman, and a pickpocket lifted his cell phone. Prior to that, it’s established that he’s living paycheck to paycheck, and isn’t sure how the family will be able to afford his teenage son’s pending college tuition, although I’d recommend driving something more practical than a BMW sport utility vehicle, and maybe moving to a house with a kitchen that’s smaller than, I dunno, 1,000 square feet.

So he’s feeling desperate when he takes a 25 percent down payment on 100 grand to stick a GPS tracking device on the as-yet-unidentified person. Who might it be? The young woman with pink punk-rock hair and a satchel full of fake IDs? The man with the heavy Eastern European accent? The African-American fellow with a porkpie hat and a guitar? The conceited Wall Street jerk jabbering into his phone? 

It’s an eventful commute: He headbutts a guy with a snake tattoo on his neck, puts another’s head through a window, and exchanges gunfire with a third potential suspect, and none of the commotion is heard by passengers or rail employees on neighboring cars. As the train barrels forward to the end of the line and Michael’s deadline, the laws of physics are either merciless or inapplicable. Meanwhile, the mysterious woman keeps calling him on a cell phone he takes from another passenger, the number for which she miraculously acquired, because as the conspiratorial mastermind of this highly engineered Movie Plot, she enjoys some of the screenwriter’s omniscience.

Liam Neeson in ""The Commuter."" (Ollie Upton | Photo provided to MLive.com by Lionsgate)

We could spend all day poking holes in “The Commuter,” but what fun is that? It’s easier to appreciate a breathless fight sequence edited to look like one long, uncut, heavily choreographed take, which every modern action movie worth its salt demands. It’s exhilarating in its brutality. As for the resolution of the core philosophical conundrum? Let’s just say Jean-Paul Sartre wouldn’t be impressed. It’s a bit of a cheat, an instance of Hollywood hogwash, where the hero can have his cake and eat it too. But as far as train-set thrillers go, I enjoyed it more than the recent reiteration of “Murder on the Orient Express,” an indulgent trip combining visual extravagance with high-minded themes only half-realized. Given the option, I’d choo-choo-choose “The Commuter” any day."
 1.5/5,The Commuter movie review: on the wrong track,MaryAnn Johanson," January 15, 2018","Remember a few years ago, when Liam Neeson was on a Non-Stop transatlantic flight between New York and London and mysterious nefarious types texted him to say that they’d kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless $150 million was transferred to their account? And how he cares about stopping this because he’s law enforcement ― the flight’s air marshal ― and doesn’t want anyone to die?

Well, The Commuter is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Here, Liam Neeson is on a TRAIN traveling from New York, yes, but only up the Hudson Valley. And it makes many STOPS at stations. And the mysterious nefarious types TALK to him, in person and on the phone. And they offer him a mere $100,000 to FIND someone on the train. He doesn’t know why they want to find this person but he figures they want to kill that person because this isn’t how you send someone flowers or whatevs, which he doesn’t want to happen because he’s EX law enforcement ― a FORMER NYPD detective ― and also because he sells life insurance so he knows the value of people. And also also because the bad guys have kidnapped his wife and will kill her if he doesn’t comply. TOTALLY NOT THE SAME MOVIE AT ALL. (Also not like Taken in the least. Nope.)
“Excuse me, is this seat Taken? Is this the Non-Stop train to Tarrytown?”

“Excuse me, is this seat Taken? Is this the Non-Stop train to Tarrytown?”

But the biggest way in which The Commuter is NOT THE SAME MOVIE AT ALL as Non-Stop is that while both movies are utterly preposterous, The Commuter never lets you forget that. Where Non-Stop was rollicking fun, The Commuter is a trial to be endured. Much like a commute itself.

Successful movies getting xeroxed is a fact of Hollywood’s business model (except when it isn’t), but usually they’re not so lazy and transparent about it. It’s as if studio execs got Non-Stop director Jaume Collet-Serra (The Shallows, Run All Night) and Neeson (Silence, A Monster Calls) in a room with Non-Stop screenwriter Ryan Engle, threw them the spec script by first-timers Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi that had been in development hell for a while, and told them to make another Non-Stop. (In fact, that does seem to be exactly what happened.) “Here’s the template: Just do it again, doesn’t need to be anything fresh or special.” It’s pretty insulting to audiences.
Imitating successful movies is a fact of Hollywood’s business model, but usually they’re not so transparent about it.

Anyway, Vera Farmiga’s (The Conjuring 2, The Judge) mysterious and nefarious “Joanna” (probably not her real name) accosts Neeson’s Michael MacCauley on his Metro-North― excuse me, “Hudson North” train home to the suburbs one night and hands him this assignment that he’s not supposed to refuse. Mike just needs to find an unknown person getting off at a particular stop carrying a bag of unknown description and drop a GPS tracker on him or her. Why Joanna doesn’t just do this job herself remains a mystery. How Joanna can do some of the other things she proves herself able to do ― such as follow up on her threat that she “can get to anyone, anywhere” on the train or off ― and not find this person of interest remains a mystery. Why Mike doesn’t catch on that the totally obvious secret other villain is actually a bad guy remains a mystery. Mike misses a lot of clues to be the supposedly great cop we’re told he was.
“What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired-- oh, wait, we’re hitting that cell signal dead zone...”

“What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquiredC oh, wait, we’re hitting that cell signal dead zone…”

The script piles on a lot of reasons why Mike might theoretically be tempted to accept this job and the payment, if he weren’t a particularly nice person: his son needs college tuition; he and his wife have multiple mortgages on their house; he’s only a few years from retirement. Yet the script also fails to give us any hint that Mike is ever genuinely tempted, that he might not be anything other than an uncomplicated upstanding citizen. I kept waiting for the clever twist that was going to up the ante on everyone, show us that Mike was perhaps not quite what we were presuming, or that the villains were perhaps not quite the bad guys they seemed. But absolutely everything in The Commuter is exactly what you expect it is going to be. For a movie that thinks it’s all about tension, there’s precious little here, and no mystery beyond the unintentional ones of all the many plotholes (of which I have mentioned only a few).

The Commuter is stuck on its one track, which is taking its high concept far too literally. So it’s hardly surprising that the movie has no idea what to do with the enormous talents onscreen. Farmiga is disgustingly wasted, as are, in supporting roles, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Sam Neill, and particularly Elizabeth McGovern as Mike’s wife. Promising and intriguing up-and-comers are given almost nothing to do: Game of Thrones’s Dean-Charles Chapman as Mike’s son, and Lady Macbeth’s Florence Pugh and Star Trek: Discovery’s Shazad Latif as passengers on the train.

And you thought your commute was hell."
,,Richard Brody," January 15, 2018","The director Jaume Collet-Serra’s unintentionally comedic action film is set mainly on an evening Metro-North train from Grand Central Terminal, where Mike McCauley (Liam Neeson), a financially strapped paterfamilias dragging himself back to Tarrytown, accepts a hundred thousand dollars from a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga) to find a passenger named Prynne who’s carrying an important bag. Mike, an ex-cop, knows how to conduct the search, and he soon has another motive: his wife and son have been kidnapped and won’t be released until the job is done. Mike fights his way through it, clobbering several passengers with his fists and another with a guitar, dangling out the window and beneath the carriage of the speeding train. He’s caught in a vast surveillance network of corrupt officials and in the web of well-worn relationships that have developed over a decade of daily round trips. Neeson’s performance is brisk and uninflected; his Mike is gaunt but unhaunted, a blank without shadows. The set pieces and the clichéd dialogue seem piled on randomly: the story and the characters would be no less developed in half the time, and the slapdash script places the suburban train line at a bunch of Manhattan stations where it doesn’t actually go."
 B-,‘The Commuter’: Liam Neeson Provides Another Enjoyably Goofy Ride [Review],Will Ashton," January 14, 2018","With “The Commuter,” director Jaume Collet-Serra and his frequent action muse Liam Neeson complete their unofficial “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” trilogy. In 2010, an uneasy taxi crashes into Berlin’s Spree and gives Neeson a bad case of amnesia in the ironically forgettable “Unknown.” In 2014, an alcoholic air marshal, played by Neeson, must stop a mysterious airborne killing spree on a plane in the surprisingly engaging “Non-Stop.” Now, with “The Commuter,” we find ourselves traveling with Neeson on a train, where a recently unemployed ex-cop-turned-insurance salesman gets caught in another murder conspiracy, one where a mysterious woman (Vera Farmiga) provides Neeson with a tantalizing offer that could either save or destroy his fragile family life before the train’s final destination.

One would assume there’s a formula in place now, and they wouldn’t necessarily be wrong. Neeson and Collet-Serra have indeed developed a bit of a working standard, which allows Neeson to continue his mature action-thriller career post-“Taken,” not dissimilar to Charles Bronson‘s robust gun-heavy late period career after the massive success of “Death Wish.” But to dismiss this latest Neeson/Collet-Serra collaboration as a disposable, unremarkable January non-starter that’s burning time and projector bulbs before finding a comfortable home inside Redbox machines would be to discredit just how knowingly, winkingly ridiculous this silly movie can be, and how Neeson and Collet-Serra are clearly having a grand time knocking around such nonsensical material for their mutual benefit.

Neeson plays Michael McCauley, the aforementioned down-on-his-luck former cop/insurance salesman, who is given the opportunity of a lifetime, even if it might cost the life of an unknown bystander on the train. When Michael is offered a $100,000 to identify a hidden passenger before the train reaches its final stop, he knows that it’s dirty money, but he also knows that it could help pay for his son’s college tuition, and that it could buffer some personal financial woes. But as he searches the moving train, surveying unfamiliar passengers, Michael gradually realizes the gravity of the situation, notably when commuters start dying on his watch.

Working with a seemingly perfunctory, by-the-numbers script by Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi, and Ryan Engle, “The Commuter” is Neeson and Collet-Serra happily indulging in their every ludicrous desire. Preposterous as the film might be, its also a social commentary on the lower middle class and the fallout of the 2008 economic recession ― particularly with Wall Street receiving a sneering, stern eye ― and its very blunt and transparent in its intentions, refusing to let even the most casual viewer walk away without a clear, present understanding of what the filmmakers are communicating here.

Through its unambiguous message and its stylish flourishes, “The Commuter” finds a nice, strange balance between absurdity and sincerity. Its goofy enough to let sprinkled moments of well-filmed action insanity have the necessary punch, yet not too goofy as to override your suspension of disbelief. “The Commuter” is far from high art, but it at least knows what it is, and it plays up its shlocky tendencies enthusiastically, letting the third act earn its way to its completely ridiculous ending.

Neeson’s committed presence is a big benefit. At 65, his action days are waning, to put it mildly, but his Michael McCauley is weathered, concerned and buoyed by gravitas, even when the movie is aware of how downright outrageous the plot elements are becoming. Similar to Collet-Serra’s surprising “The Shallows,” the film is boosted by the director’s surefire confidence and strong attention to its cinematic flair. Indeed, much like “Murder on the Orient Express,” the stationary train location never loses its cinematic grandeur, as the director keeps finding enjoyable and inventive ways to keep the sterile location active and humming. And even when “The Commuter” literally goes off-the-rails, Collet-Serra drives the train with gleeful abandonment to logic or reason. You wish more filmmakers could willfully go this slapdash insane while still holding your marvelled attention. It’s to Collet-Serra’s underrated credit that he understands the value of dopey action thrillers and savors them, creating a moderately enjoyable ride with well-tuned quirks.

As far as Neeson’s recent action-thrillers go, “The Commuter” is decidedly somewhere down the middle. It intentionally lacks the nuances of “The Gray” and “A Walk Among the Tombstones,” but it avoids being as completely forgettable and derivative as “Run All Night,” another Collect-Sera/Neeson joint, and the “Taken” sequels. With a filmography as curiously inconsistent as Collet-Serra’s, “The Commuter” is a wild, mostly entertaining combination of the director’s general bag of tricks. It’s over-the-top and fun, even if in its own fleeting way, and by the time you’ve reached your stop, you don’t feel swindled. [B-]"
 2/5,REVIEW: Action man Liam Neeson still strong in B-grade thriller The Commuter,Vicky Roach," January 14, 2018","Liam Neeson says he’s done making action films.

“I’m sixty-f ― king-five,” he told journalists at the Toronto Film Festival a few months back. “Audiences are eventually going to go: ‘Come on.’”

If The Commuter, the distinguished Irish actor’s penultimate outing in said genre, is anything to go by, his impending “retirement” can’t happen quickly enough.

Age, however, is not the issue in this unsavoury B-grade thriller ― Neeson is still a remarkably virile screen presence.

It’s the screenplay that derails him as a performer on the back of a string of lucrative but questionable career choices that have undermined an impressive body of work (from Silence to Schindler’s List).

Taken, an ugly vigilante film that spawned two sequels, marked Neeson’s unlikely transformation into a kick-ass avenger upon its release in 2008.

He and The Commuter’s director Jaume Collet-Serra have already churned out three action-thrillers, Unknown (2011), Non-Stop (2014) and Run All Night (2015).

In their latest collaboration, Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a by-the-book insurance salesman who has been catching the same train to work every day since handing in his police badge ― for the sake of his family.

Having remortgaged his house to send his son to college, he is backed into a corner after being unceremoniously retrenched by his employer.

That desperation explains why he is momentarily tempted by the “hypothetical” proposition of an enigmatic stranger (Vera Farmiga) who approaches him on the train on the way home, offering a large sum of money in return for one anonymous act.

Before he has fully understood what’s at stake, MacCauley has entered into a Faustian pact from which there is no going back.

The body count quickly mounts up as he tries to put together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle involving a crime, an eyewitness, and a bunch of corrupt officials.

Most of the deaths are at his brutally efficient hand.

Neeson has a knack for making his characters seem more honourable than their behaviour ― but ultimately a man is the sum of his acts.

And the saccharine portrayal of MacCauley’s domestic life sits uncomfortably alongside the bloody events on the train.

In The Commuter, Neeson, like his character, is simply punching the clock."
 C,Movies: Train thriller ‘Commuter’ quickly goes off track,Dana Barbuto," January 14, 2018","In “The Commuter,” another late-career actioner, Liam Neeson takes his save-the-day shenanigans aboard the 6:25 train to Cold Spring, a bumpy ride on which he must root out bad guys or it’s the end of the line for his family.

The movie marks the fourth collaboration between Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, and no shock, it pretty much follows the formula of the other three, “Non-stop,” “Run All Night” and “Unknown.” The only exception is the railroad setting. Collet-Serra (“The Shallows”) can schlock and awe with the best of them, but “The Commuter” is derailed by rampant implausibility. The script, by a trio of writers (Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle), wants to send a message about choices and consequences, but all you really want is Neeson to use those famous “particular set of skills” to kick bad-guy butt in inventive ways. Pass the popcorn.

Neeson is ex-cop turned insurance salesman Michael MacCauley, an ordinary guy five years from retirement who begins this very bad day bantering with Walt (“Breaking Bad’s” Jonathan Banks) and the other regulars on his daily commute to Manhattan. Later, Mike loses his job. The timing sucks C he and wife, Karen (Elizabeth McGovern in a nothing part), already live paycheck-to-paycheck, carry two mortgages and struggle to pay the college tuition for their only son (Dean-Charles Chapman). In other words, theirs is a typical financially overburdened American middle-class existence.

A mystery woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga), wearing a serious pair of black-and-white pumps, approaches Mike on the evening express and makes him an offer he can’t refuse: $100,000 to find someone on the train “who doesn’t belong” and plant a GPS tracking device in that person’s bag before the last stop. There’s an envelope of cash stashed in the restroom. If he takes the money, it’s an acknowledgment that he agrees to do the job. Joanna vanishes.

Since there’d be no movie if he doesn’t take the bait, Mike soon finds himself walking up and down the train trying to find the target C a person called “Prynne.” Is it the obnoxious Wall Street trader? The girl with pink hair and bag full of stolen credit cards? The guitar-carrying guy? It’s not long before Mike realizes he’s caught up in some criminal conspiracy and pivots when his family is threatened. As the train chugs along the Hudson, the plot contrivances grow sillier. It’s a miracle Neeson keeps a straight face in the midst of a growing onboard body count. Joanna sends menacing messages via other passengers, and she seems to have also commandeered the train’s controls. Neeson desperately keeps fighting, taking a few beatings and administering a couple of his own.

Early on, the action builds slowly as we get to know Mike and other supporting characters, like Patrick Wilson and Sam Neill’s NYPD officers, then, like the train Mike is riding, the whole thing jumps the track with too much exposition and predictable double crosses. Tension is in short supply. Obvious red herrings don’t throw us off the trail. Neeson tries C in all his Everyman glory C to make us believe in Mike. But everything about “The Commuter” is unreal.

Movie review THE COMMUTER (PG-13 for some intense action/violence, and language.) Cast: Liam Neeson, Vera Farmiga, Sam Neill, Patrick Wilson, Jonathan Banks, Elizabeth McGovern. Grade: C"
 1/5,,Nick Rogers," January 13, 2018","The Neesploitation genre shifts from arthritic debilitation (Run All Night) to senile incontinence with The Commuter ― an action film with a hook so dumb that Liam Neeson’s recitation of it to another character creates the following exchange:

    Superfluous Secondary Dude: “Not much to go on.”

    Generically Irish Liam Neeson Character: “Tell me about it.”

Michael MacCauley, that’s it. Drinks at a place called Paddy O’Rourke’s or something. Not just Irish. Super Irish. He drinks beside a pal played by a well-known character actor whose presence lets you know that 1) he must have needed to pay for something and 2) he will be integral to what befalls Michael.

Michael is an ex-cop turned life insurance salesman who loses his job on the verge of sending his son ― who is smart because he reads lots of novels ― off to college. We see Michael lose the job in a scene that suggests Neeson’s growling version of Up in the Air. He lost his pension, too, in 2008, prompting him to shout, howlingly verbatim, the following at a Goldman Sachs stockbroker: “Hey, Goldman Sachs! On behalf of the American middle class, fuck you!”

Unclear, though, is why Michael is no longer a police officer. Perhaps that explanation is swallowed up amid the first-act excitement of seeing Michael check ticket punches, scan timetables, sit down, lean forward and / or investigate suspiciously clean train bathrooms.

Ah, yes! The train, through which a CGI camera zooms from front to back ― illustrating that this train, like most others, is a long tube. Michael has taken the same line for 10 years. On it, people strike up random poker games with strangers. Is that not what happens on your commuter train?

It’s here that a conspiratorial cabal eager to off a witness to one of its crimes before he / she talks to the feds choose to engage Michael in some sort of screenwriters’ psychology thesis rather than just killing the person. If Michael will only put a tracker on said witness ― one of his fellow travelers ―he will be $100,000 richer and guilt-free from having done no physical harm himself, right? If you’re wondering why the FBI would ask a witness to meet them at a suburban train station rather than take said witness into protective custody, well, Lionsgate probably isn’t going to make your Liam Neeson movie so THERE!

Now this is the point where The Commuter turns into a thing where Neeson beats a bad guy senseless with a guitar, stabs him with a tuning knob and then hurls his dumb ass onto the tracks, all edited to feel like a single take before Neeson clings to the guitar neck like a fading rock star. It’s the sole moment of distinction in this fourth pairing of Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, who peaked with Non-Stop and repeat it here to vastly diminishing returns, right down to the authorities believing Michael is the terrorist mastermind.

That guitar attack is also the moment where you feel, yet again, that Neeson is just gaslighting us with these oft-quoted stories of him really being too old for this shit this time. What the hell else is he going to do? Observe how casually nonchalant everyone on the train is when he pulls a gun. They’re no dummies. They probably fell asleep during Unknown and Run All Night on TNT, too.

Like Adam Sandler’s character in Funny People became to Sandler in real life, Neeson is just making the movies about which he used to joke. At this point, I fully expect to see Missile Tow ― the fake film for which he contributed a voice cameo in Daddy’s Home 2 ― as a real thing by 2020. That said, it couldn’t be worse than Daddy’s Home 2.

As for The Commuter, it just gets you thinking about how many mysteries set on a train are preferable. The answer? All of them, even Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express; burnishing that by comparison is really quite something. Late in The Commuter, Neeson stands next to a headline that reads “Make the Most of Your Weekends This Fall.” Heed its advice: Watch one of those movies then instead of this garbage when it premieres on Starz or whatever."
 2.5/4,,Matt Brunson," January 13, 2018","Planes, Trains and Automobiles might be the name of a beloved John Hughes flick from the 1980s, but it’s also Liam Neeson’s preferred modes of transportation en route to dispatching various baddies with bone-crunching determination. Under the watchful eye of director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson has taken to cars in Unknown, an airplane in Non-Stop, and now a locomotive in The Commuter. (In their joint offering Run All Night, the actor was content just to hoof it.)

In The Commuter, Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a former cop who has spent the past decade working as an insurance salesman. Unexpectedly losing his job, Michael’s in a vulnerable state, which largely explains why, on his train ride home, he accepts a mysterious offer from a complete stranger (Vera Farmiga): Locate a certain person on the train and earn an easy $100,000. Michael takes the bait, but once he realizes that the individual he’s expected to expose is being targeted for assassination, he spends the rest of the commute trying to figure out how to thwart the killers.

The January-February stretch of any new year is often a dumping ground for the studios’ tax write-offs, but that’s clearly not the case when it comes to Liam Neeson action vehicles ― here, it’s a matter of strategic scheduling, as most have tended to do quite well at the box office against limp competition. The Commuter similarly gets the job done, with Neeson’s committed performance providing a strong center to an increasingly outlandish storyline. The identity of the “surprise” villain was obvious before the script was even written (and the way he trips himself up is daft beyond compare), and late innings find Neeson’s Everyman engaged in death-defying activities that would give even Superman pause. But for those looking for a reasonably satisfying mix of mystery and muscle, The Commuter should be just the ticket."
,"‘The Commuter’ Review: A Very Welcome, Old-Fashioned Action Flick",Tomris Laffly," January 13, 2018","Liam Neeson’s punches save the day in this satisfying, 90s-inspired Jaume Collet-Serra locomotive.

And here we thought Kenneth Baranagh’s Murder on the Orient Express was going to be the splashy train mystery of the season. But a modern-day Metro North train with a badass Liam Neeson aboard hijacks that seat smoothly as soon as it leaves New York City’s Grand Central Station in Jaume Collet-Serra’s slick, deliberately over-the-top action-thriller The Commuter. If you’ve seen his efficient, Blake Lively-starring shark movie The Shallows or glossy horror flick Orphan, you already know that Collet-Serra is a reliable name behind the camera to own up to genre clichés and use them with remarkable finesse and economy. He is at it again with The Commuter that shamelessly (actually, let’s make it “proudly”) nods to certain action staples of the 1990s―Speed, Money Train, Daylight, you name it―with a straight face. The result is a silly, yet knowingly old-fashioned action movie, very welcome in an era where only characters wearing spandex in mind-numbing, jumbled action sequences seem to have all the fun. So when The Commuter’s inevitable “next time, take the bus” zinger arrives in its well-orchestrated finale, you can’t help but cheer for the earned cheesiness.

In his fourth collaboration with Collet-Serra, Liam Neeson plays Michael MacCauley, a regular Joe with no particular set of skills. (Well, he is an insurance salesman and somehow also an ex-cop, so I guess he does have some skills under his belt.) A suburbanite who takes the same train every day to his monotonous job that he takes pride in, Michael worries about paying his mortgage like countless honest, working American men and sending his teenage son to college alongside his wife (an underutilized Elizabeth McGovern). Through nicely spliced opening credits, artfully edited by Nicolas De Toth (the film’s MVP), we get a sense of Michael’s well-established, time-tested routine, until one day he loses his job unexpectedly for some bizarre excuse. Unwilling to go home early and share the bad news with his supportive spouse, Michael grabs a drink with his trusted buddy Alex (The Conjuring’s Patrick Wilson) before heading to his usual train, where troubles await.

If you were Michael, a hand-to-mouth employee with long years of good service in a dead-end career, what would you do if Vera Farmiga in stylish heels all of a sudden approached you and offered $100K in exchange of one quick, little favor? Like any normal person, Michael inquires about the nature of the favor first. His mission is to find an indistinct passenger on that entire train (with no visual description whatsoever) and tag their bag with a GPS tracker before they get off at the Cold Spring station. Michael agrees at first, suspiciously walking up and down the train cars, making way too much noise and driving excessive attention to himself in his laughable attempts to find his target. (Side note: I would immediately disembark any train with a bruised, sweaty dude restlessly pacing the aisles back and forth.) But soon after, his dignity takes charge and he heroically decides to act in the interest of the passengers against invisible perpetrators that threaten to kill his family, and against Vera Farmiga, who continues to fire orders to him over the phone.

Through an entertaining script penned by Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle, The Commuter uses its limited assets well, eventhough it ignores certain locational facts (such as, commuter trains don’t stop at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue. Come on!) Eventually, we get left alone with a handful of passengers all of whom are suspects and an increasingly desperate Michael, who swiftly beats up some bad guys against a racing clock. Don’t expect The Commuter to make a whole lot of sense in the end (because, well, it won’t.) But there is something undeniably appealing about kicking the year off at the movies with Liam Neeson’s unforgiving punches in a classically nonsensical action film à la Taken. This coherently choreographed, semi-Hitchcockian thriller is not only fun, but it also feels right from the start."
,Liam Neeson(s) in The Commuter,Sarah Marrs," January 12, 2018","Last summer, director Jaume Collet-Serra scored with the sleeper hit The Shallows,  the Blake Lively vs. A Shark movie that is ridiculous, but in that fun, schlocky way that is entirely watchable. That movie was a nice break from the Liam Neeson Revenge Man movies he had been making to diminishing returns, and it served as a reminder that Collet-Serra is a good director, with a penchant for the scary stuff. Well, he’s back (already) with another Liam Neeson Revenge Man movie, and it undoes all the good work of The Shallows in reminding us what Collet-Serra can do when he’s engaged. This iteration of Not Taken, But Like Taken is called The Commuter, and it’s pretty much an exact remake of one of Collet-Serra’s previous movies with Neeson, the unforgivably stupid Non-Stop. But this time, instead of the action occurring on a plane, it occurs on a train. Will their next movie be a revenge thriller in a car? Go for the trilogy, guys!

Neeson stars as Joe Revenge―his character has a name, but who can remember it?―an ex-cop who became an insurance salesman, as one does. One day, after being fired, Joe Revenge gets on his usual train to the ’burbs, wondering what the hell he’s going to tell his family about getting fired. Only his commute is interrupted when Vera Farmiga sits with him and tells him he can have $100,000 if only he’ll find a person who “doesn’t belong” on the train. With a son about to go to college and two mortgages sucking him dry, Joe Revenge is desperate for cash. He sets out to find this person who “doesn’t belong”. If you’re wondering if The Commuter makes a racial profiling joke, the answer is yes.

This movie is unbelievably dumb. The Shallows is stupid, too, but it’s put together well and it’s just the right amount of schlocky to be fun. The Commuter is not especially well done and is quite ugly to look at―Collet-Serra can and has done better―and it’s not schlocky as much as sad. Neeson is starting to look too old for these action movies, and what was once a fun late-career reinvention is now tired. He doesn’t even look like he’s enjoying himself, he’s just going through the motions and visibly checking out in several scenes. The whole thing feels like an obligation, which makes watching it feel like a chore.

I will give this credit to The Commuter: It has a balls-out crazy ending. Just absolutely the dumbest f*cking sh*t in the world, executed with the gritty determination of people who really want to go home. It’s so breathtakingly stupid, it’s almost impressive. We’re talking “1980’s cocaine-fueled action movie” stupid. The gold standard for such stupid endings is, of course, Road House and the taxidermy room, and while The Commuter’s ending isn’t nearly as good as that―nothing is, to be fair, except maybe the ending of Speed―it’s done in the same spirit of “might as well take it THAT far”. This is not a recommendation for The Commuter (it is, however, a recommendation for Road House). There is no recommendation for The Commuter. The only people who will watch The Commuter are people on planes with broken seat-TVs that will only play The Commuter. And even then, I bet most of them choose to do literally anything else, up to and including crash the plane."
 2.5/5,The Commuter review: Liam Neeson's tough guy runs out of steam in train thriller,Jake Wilson," January 12, 2018","It's odd that The Commuter, the latest vehicle for 65-year-old tough guy Liam Neeson, has not been saved for Father's Day. The title and premise seem calculated to appeal to dads stuck in the rat race, dozing through their journey to and from work and dreaming of snapping the necks of fellow passengers who talk too loud on their mobile phones.

Neeson is not the only modern action hero to have kept up the trade into his senior years: think of Sylvester Stallone's Expendables series, for starters. But with his doughy good looks, lilting voice and determined joylessness, he more than any star embodies violence buried deep beneath a respectable facade.

That said, The Commuter is far less violent than Neeson's Taken franchise C as much paranoid thriller as action movie, though it owes a debt to Die Hard with a Vengeance, among other action favourites involving fiendish puzzles set by villains from afar. It's also, more intriguingly, a train film C a genre which is difficult to get completely wrong, given that virtually any story becomes more gripping when the characters are being carried along at speed.

The train in question is headed out from Manhattan towards the New York suburbs, where Neeson's ex-cop hero Michael MacCauley lives with his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and young son (Dean-Charles Chapman). Having just lost his job selling insurance, MacCauley is already having one of the worst days of his life when a woman of mystery (Vera Farmiga) forces him to use his professional skills to identify an assassination target C giving him an hour or so to figure out the situation, seize the upper hand and save the day before he reaches the end of the line.

This is the fourth collaboration between Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra, whose last film was the enticing shark attack thriller The Shallows, with Blake Lively as the isolated heroine surrounded by glistening expanses of sky and sea. The Commuter is a systematic reversal of its predecessor, giving us an ageing man instead of a young woman, a confined space instead of a wide open one C and, instead of glittering blue water, the haze and grime of a city in late afternoon.

Still, both films take place over a limited time span, both involve ""ordinary"" characters thrown into extreme situations C and both demonstrate Jaume-Serra's above average skill at establishing tone by visual means. He and cinematographer Paul Cameron (Collateral) opt for a murky look that emphasises the limits of MacCauley's perceptions, using shallow focus and unsteady camerawork; light flickers on faces as the train rushes along, dimming as the sun goes down.

The glimmers of beauty arise from the contrast between the fleeting, intangible views from the train window and the solid problems MacCauley has to solve on board, which he approaches with a tinkerer's logic (such as when he finds an ingenious way of forcing all the passengers to gather in the one compartment). There's also a frisson in the idea that danger can exist even in the most mundane settings: we're kept aware that a train is a huge hunk of metal hurtling across the landscape, a terrifying prospect whether you're in the belly of the beast or standing in its path.

However, Collet-Serra can only do so much to redeem a mechanical, even feeble script (the final version is credited to Ryan Engle, who previously worked with Collet-Serra on the Neeson vehicle Non-Stop). We're kept guessing to the last moment about which characters can be trusted, but the answer only matters if we care about any of them in the first place C and we're given little reason to do so, though they're played by a potentially strong group of actors, including Sam Neill and Patrick Wilson as cops MacCauley stays in touch with by phone.

As for Neeson, to call him a ""reliable"" actor is a polite way of saying he has few surprises left in him; his relentlessly even manner dampens down any possible excitement. It was probably a mistake for Collet to cast Jonathan Banks C otherwise known as Mike, the fixer from Breaking Bad C in a minor role: when it comes to weary but indomitable toughness, it is difficult to believe any character played by Banks wouldn't leave Neeson far behind."
 2.5/5,The Commuter Review: Liam Neeson’s Ticket to Ride is Silly Fun,Sandy Schaefer," January 12, 2018","Having collaborated for three films already, actor Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra reunite for their fourth and possibly silliest thriller yet with The Commuter. Collet-Serra made his name as a skilled schlockmeister with his House of Wax remake and horror/thriller Orphan in the 2000s, before he joined forces with Neeson (in the post-Taken stage of his acting career) for the 2011 mystery/thriller Unknown. The pair has since tried their hand at something a little more high-minded with the dramatic crime thriller Run All Night, but The Commuter has much more in common with their 2014 murder mystery Non-Stop. The Commuter is a goofy and formulaic thriller, but also an entertaining one thanks to Neeson’s action star chops and Collet-Serra’s sense of style.

Michael McCauley (Neeson) is a sixty year old insurance salesman as well as an ex-cop, who has spent the last ten years commuting to work by train. When Michael is fired from his job one day for no particularly good reason, he is left trying to figure out how he and his wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) will be able to make ends meet, what with their son Danny (Dean-Charles Chapman) about to start college. On his ride home that day, Michael is approached by a mysterious woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga) who makes him an offer: he will be paid $100,00 if he can figure out which of the passengers on the train is carrying something precious in their bag.

Liam Neeson in The Commuter

Michael dismisses the encounter as a strange joke, but soon discovers that Joanna is completely serious, and that there will be terrible consequences if he doesn’t make good on their “deal”. As Michael races against the clock to find the mystery passenger before they get off the train, he comes to realize that not only his own life, but the lives of every passenger onboard, and even his own family, is at risk if he fails.

The Commuter is very similar to Non-Stop from a script perspective C which only makes sense, as Non-Stop cowriter Ryan Engle also co-penned this film, based on an earlier screenplay written by relative unknowns Philip de Blasi and Byron Willinger. While the film’s Agatha Christie inspired premise lends itself to a cracking mystery, The Commuter doesn’t do anything particularly inventive or unique with the formula. Most of the red herrings and plot twists that The Commuter throws out are easy to spot ahead of time, and the actual solution to the larger conflict is clearly telegraphed early on in the narrative. Fortunately, The Commuter is less concerned with crafting a mind-blowing puzzle for viewers to solve, and more focused on delivering the sort of relentless thrill ride that audiences have come to expect whenever Neeson plays the world’s greatest problem-solving dad.
Vera Farmiga in The Commuter The Commuter Review: Liam Neesons Ticket to Ride is Silly Fun

Vera Farmiga in The Commuter

Michael McCauley is at first presented as more of a regular person than the characters Neeson has played in his previous collaborations with Collet-Serra. In function, however, Michael isn’t all that different from Neeson’s other action/thriller protagonists, and the actor delivers most of his lines with the same gruff voiced intensity that he’s fine-tuned since he first demonstrated his “particular set of skills”. Collet-Serra and his production team take advantage of the film’s enclosed setting to stage The Commuter‘s close quarter fight scenes in a way that makes it believable enough (for the film’s purposes) that Neeson’s cop turned insurance agent wouldn’t be completely overwhelmed by his opponents. The movie also incorporates some stylistic flourishes (sped up motion, sequence shots seemingly created in post-production) in these scenes, to further spice things up.

As he has done in his previous collaborations with Neeson, Collet-Serra fills out The Commuter‘s supporting cast with A-list talent. In addition to Farmiga (who previously worked with Collet-Serra on Orphan) and her Conjuring movies costar Patrick Wilson, the movie further benefits from having seasoned character actors like McGovern filling out its ensemble, as well as Jonathan Banks and Sam Neill in smaller roles. Most of the film’s characters C especially the train passengers played by lesser known actors C are the sort of two-dimensional stock types that one expects to find in this sort of pulpy fare. The Commuter is above all else the Liam Neeson show, and it wisely never loses sight of that throughout its runtime.
Sam Neill in The Commuter The Commuter Review: Liam Neesons Ticket to Ride is Silly Fun

Sam Neill in The Commuter

Collet-Serra is known for infusing his B-grade movies with slick production values, and that remains the case with The Commuter. The director typically makes good use of the environments in his films, be it the inescapable inside of the airplane from Non-Stop or the beautiful and isolated beach in The Shallows. He likewise uses the cramped and dingy interiors of a commuter train to positive effect here, when it comes to generating suspense and tension. Working with cinematographer Paul Cameron (Collateral, Dead Man Down), Collet-Serra stylishly maps out the internal layout of the film’s central set piece and keeps things visually engaging, in spite of the unchanging foreground scenery. The downside is, The Commuter is more interested in getting to the next scene of Neeson punching someone than it is fleshing out its characters or exploring the political overtones of its narrative.

The Commuter is neither Neeson nor Collet-Serra’s best thriller yet, but it’s a perfectly serviceable genre movie that delivers everything audiences expect from Neeson’s action films nowadays C to a fault. It’s not a film that demands to be seen in a theater, and it falls well short of breaking the mold that Neeson and Collet-Serra have established for their movies together by now. At the same time, The Commuter is enjoyably ridiculous and offers enough entertainment to help beat away the doldrums of January. Here’s to hoping Neeson’s and Collet-Serra’s “Taken On A Boat”, or whatever moving vehicle their next thriller takes place on, is equally fun."

 6/10,‘The Commuter’ Review: Liam Neeson’s “Old Man Action Hero” Thing Still Works,Karen Han," January 12, 2018","At this point, Liam Neeson movies are practically a genre unto themselves, and Liam Neeson-Jaume Collet-Serra movies are quite possibly their apex. The Commuter is one of the best of the bunch. Even though it’s not really anything you haven’t seen before, Neeson’s commitment to the role and Collet-Serra’s at times inspired direction make for a movie that’s hell on wheels. Sure, you can see some of the twists coming from a mile away, but it’s a forgivable sin when they’re executed with so much panache.

For instance, we’ve all seen montages used to denote the passage of time, but not quite the way that Collet-Serra does to open the film. What he gives us is a sort of composite Groundhog Day, a single routine shown to us over the course of a seemingly endless number of days as it repeats over and over again, sunny on some occasions and cloudy on others, overlapping right up until Neeson finally gets onto his commuter train.

As Michael MacCauley, a former cop currently peddling insurance to provide for his wife and son, Neeson is unreasonably great. On paper, his character isn’t all that interesting, but the level of intensity and earnestness that Neeson brings to every role he’s ever taken raise MacCauley ― and everything around him, as almost every cast member is a caricature ― to another level. There’s Shazad Latif as the business bro, Andy Nyman as the chatty neighbor, Florence Pugh as the punk teen ― everyone is playing a part in the most literal sense possible (and with the clunky dialogue to boot), but it comes together.

On his way home after being fired and thereby left in the lurch with a reverse-mortgage that’s been taken in order to pay for his son’s college tuition, MacCauley meets a woman (Vera Farmiga) who poses a hypothetical scenario. There’s a passenger on this train that doesn’t belong. If he can figure out who that passenger is before the end of the line, he’ll receive $100,000 in cash. Obviously this isn’t actually a hypothetical ― if he doesn’t mark the passenger with a tracker (that will then signal someone else on board to kill them), then his family will be killed. And just in case he starts getting cocky, they kill off the very first passenger he enlists to help him.

As indicated by the reason behind MacCauley’s desperation, there’s a little class commentary at work in The Commuter. It never quite manages to coalesce ― none of the overt morals of the film do ― in part because the movie is ultimately so singularly about Neeson kicking ass and taking names (and briefly being schooled on the Bront? sisters by an understated Jonathan Banks) that there’s no space for anything else. And that’s just fine.

Or close to it, anyway. For the most part, the film zips along, but there’s an entire act at the end that could probably have been chopped off or otherwise condensed, with the lean, mean fun of the bulk of the film suddenly bloating into the grim, explosive theatrics that tend to dominate so many blockbusters these days. It’s an unnecessary spectacle, as is only proven by how much more hair-raising the first half of the film is when it’s just Liam Neeson in, on, and around a train, utilizing everything he can in order to stay alive. The shot in which Collet-Serra pulls back from Neeson’s shocked face and then back through the entire train is more thrilling than any of the fireworks that end the movie.

At its heart, The Commuter is very much a how movie rather than a why movie. Yes, there’s a why to be sussed out C why MacCauley, why this passenger, etc. ― but it’s not like any character played by Liam Neeson is ever going to completely turn his back on being moral. So, while it’s fun trying to piece together what’s going on, it’s the how that really makes or breaks the movie, and boy, does it make it. How is he going to get back on a moving train after falling out of the bottom of it? How is he going to survive bringing an electric guitar to a knife fight?

The supporting cast is stacked enough that it’s a bit of a pity to see them turn into grist on the Neeson mill (Elizabeth McGovern plays MacCauley’s wife and appears in maybe a minute of the film), but that’s to be expected. This is a film built on a particular formula, after all. And it’s a formula that works. This is now the fourth time that Neeson and Collet-Serra have worked together, with Unknown (2011), Non-Stop (2014), and Run All Night (2015) already under their belts, and as previously mentioned, they’ve boiled this down to such an art that it’s fun to imagine what might come next. Planes, check; trains, check; there are only so many more places to go that are quite so contained as environments for a man to suffer a crisis of conscience, but it’s hard not to hope that the options will be limitless. A boat seems like the obvious next choice. Then a stretch limo, maybe?"
,,Annlee Ellingson," January 12, 2018",
,The Hidden Hunger for Communism in Action Thriller The Commuter,Charles Mudede," January 12, 2018","The first great film of 2018 is (for me at least), The Commuter. It stars the Irishman Liam Neeson, and is directed by the Spaniard Jaume Collet-Serra. This is their fourth and second-best collaboration. Their best film is, of course, Non-Stop, which is very much like The Commuter, except it takes place on an airplane. The Commuter happens on a train that links Manhattan to the suburbs. Neeson is an insurance salesman and former cop (Michael) who has ""taken"" this train for a long decade. He is a father, married, 60 years old, and juggling two mortgages.

Shit hits the fan on the very day he is laid off. He leaves his Manhattan office and, with the heaviest eyes in Hollywood, faces his mounting debts and expenses. He goes to an Irish pub to drink and think. What is he supposed to do now? He has played the capitalist game by the rules. No one can question his work ethic, yet, in the end, the system treated him no better than a beggar.

During the long train ride home, Neeson gives a Goldman Sachs exec the middle finger and says: ""Fuck you, from the middle class."" That's when the fun really begins. Yes, sir, it's that kind of film. It's got lots of action and tension. It has an amazing scene that involves smashing an electric guitar on someone's head. Neeson is almost killed by the baddies or the train several times.

But if you look beyond the thrills and ox-stunning blows (thank you, Nabokov), you find that all of the leading characters in the movie are tired of always just getting by. The commuters are grounded every fucking day by the downward pressure of the wage-labor market. All of this says something that is very important: Workers and bosses are not at all partners in the profit-making enterprise. The relationship is antagonistic and volatile. It can explode at any moment. This is Red Hollywood at its best. "
 3/5,,Randall King," January 12, 2018",
 7.1/10,,Andy Crump," January 12, 2018","You know we’re running out of action movies for Liam Neeson to chew through when the industry has to mash Strangers on a Train with Unstoppable, then mash that concoction with Murder on the Orient Express, then layer the resultant amalgam over a standard Neeson, Action Star? plot. Then call it something vague like The Commuter. At the same time, the industry knows how to hook a Neeson audience: If you habitually buy tickets for his old-manly action movies, you’re already in the bag for The Commuter, and if you’re in the bag for The Commuter, the synopsis either doesn’t matter or you threw a fist pump after reading it. “Liam Neeson? On a train? Solving mysteries and punching people? Sweet!”

The plain truth is that The Commuter kicks all kinds of ass. Neeson’s action film credits are reliably unreliable, alternating between utter wastes of time and enjoyably macho fantasies, but he’s developed a groove with Jaume Collet-Serra ever since 2011’s Unknown. The Commuter is their fourth team-up and a welcome return to their established actor-director dynamic following their last, 2015’s Run All Night, a well-meaning movie that’s sorely mistaken about its own importance. Nothing lets the air out of a crowded theater like a self-serious potboiler, much less a self-serious potboiler needlessly wound into knots.

The Commuter rebounds from Run All Night’s hubris, fitting better alongside Unknown and 2014’s Non-Stop as a goofy, high-stakes-but-small-scale actioner wherein Neeson plays Michael McCauley, an average Joe tasked with unmasking a shadowy criminal conspiracy. Really, he’s a veteran ex-cop who hops the commuter train into the city each day to work a thankless job hawking insurance, but he puts on an average Joe face in public, whether to his clients, to his family or to his fellow commuters. (You get the idea that this is how Neeson lives his life, too, pretending he’s merely a down-to-earth type and not at all a grizzled badass.) Then one day he’s unceremoniously let go by his employer, and after catching a beer with his old pal from the force, he gets on the train home and gets caught in the web of a woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga).

Joanna, flirty at first and menacing not long after, challenges him to find an unknown passenger on the train―a stranger on the train, you might say―and slap a GPS locator on their bag before they pull into the last stop on the line. His reward: a hundred grand to ease the sting of his firing. But the challenge isn’t easy, or even non-fatal, and as Michael reaches into his bag of cop tricks to figure out the identity of the passenger, threats are made and bodies start piling up.

If there’s a gripe worth holding against the film it’s that Collet-Serra is already repeating his greatest hits with Neeson, lifting Non-Stop’s “search for the culprit” structure, the only difference being that in The Commuter the culprit isn’t actually guilty of a crime. Though, funny enough, watching Collet-Serra and Neeson lean back on what works for them works for us. The Commuter knows how to take advantage of its setting and distinguish itself from its predecessors in the process. Where Non-Stop uses alcoholism as a plot-motivating character detail, The Commuter uses economic anxiety couched in the 2008 financial crisis. The McCauleys lost their savings in that cluster. Michael thinks twice about accepting Joanna’s offer, but he stops short of thinking three times. He needs the money. Desperate times, desperate measures―you know the drill.

Collet-Serra isn’t pompous enough to package The Commuter as stirring commentary on that global meltdown. He only pays off the reference by having Michael flip off an asshole stockbroker riding the train with him, openly disdainful of taking public transportation. Instead, Collet-Serra focuses on going over the top, affixing increasingly loopy twists and turns to what could have been a straightforwardly shameless riff on one of Hitchcock’s most streamlined masterpieces. (It’s worth noting that the film is a love letter to that director’s work through and through, from Rear Window to North by Northwest.) Turns out that the FBI has Joanna on their radar, that other passengers might be playing her game, too, and that she might have cops in her pocket. The more the movie throws at us, the more that Michael’s suspicions become our own and the more delicious Collet-Serra’s excesses become.

The Commuter isn’t a tough puzzle to solve, and it veers closely to being obvious at times. But easy, unsubtle, unabashedly masculine action films don’t need nuance as long as they’re this much of a goofy pleasure to watch. Sometimes you just want an actor like Neeson to fend off an attacker with an electric guitar. If we’re to take Neeson at his word, The Commuter is his last time playing action hero. Too bad, but then again, there are only so many times bad guys can put common man Neeson’s family in harm’s way before the mileage runs out on the setup."
 2.5/4,Neeson’s Commuter Beats Getting Stuck in Rush Hour Traffic,Sara Michelle Fetters," January 12, 2018","Michael MacCauley (Liam Neeson) has had better days. The former New York detective has been working as a successful insurance agent for the past decade, this job change allowing he and his realtor wife Karen (Elizabeth McGovern) get their family back on their feet after the housing and financial crisis of 2008 wiped them out. Just as things were looking up, with their son Danny (Dean-Charles Chapman) about to head off to college, out of the blue he’s given the sack, sent packing by his employer with him and his family’s health insurance covered for the next year as a severance package instead of a cash payout.

On the commuter train home, a trip he has taken every day, back and forth for the past decade, a mysterious woman calling herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga) sits down across from him and offers Michael a perplexing one-time job offer. She’ll pay him $100,000 if the ex-cop can figure out who on this train does not belong. They’ll be carrying a bag. They’ll be getting off at a certain stop near the end of the line. They go by the nickname “Prin.” That’s all the information Joanna offers, and while she’s willing to be generous to Michael, she’s also not going to let him turn her down, and she’ll threaten the lives of his wife and son if she has to in order to get him to do what it is she wants.

The Commuter is a silly B-grade action-thriller with Neeson giving an impassioned performance that, while not exactly all that far removed from his ones in Taken, Non-Stop or Unknown, is still delivered with more grit and gravitas than this inane little scenario deserves. Reuniting with Run All Night director Jaume Collet-Serra for the fourth time, the actor and the filmmaker have an obviously comfortable rapport. Together, they seem to know what works and what doesn’t, and as minor as this over-plotted piece of unabashed genre hokum might be, the whole things ends up being far more entertaining and fun to watch than it easily has any right to be.

Not to say this is some minor masterwork people will be falling all over themselves to heap praise on. This is the kind of movie that’s very easy to enjoy when you’re not paying a first-run ticket price. Seeing at a bargain matinee at a second run theatre? Heck yes. Watching it on Cable television while you’re folding laundry or doing any variety of mundane household chores? Absolutely. But it’s unlikely anyone going to an evening show during the first couple weeks of release will feel as if they got their money’s worth. It all so mercilessly harebrained and inadvertently humorous there were moments where I felt Neeson and Collet-Serra were making a parody of the sort of thrillers they’ve had such financial success with these past few years and not something I was supposed to treat with anything resembling seriousness, a bit of an obnoxious problem if I do say so myself.

Yet I admittedly had a pretty terrific time. Neeson owns characters like Michael, and watching him play off Farmiga in a pair of expertly staged one-on-one bookend scenes is a delicious treat. I also liked the way in which Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi and Ryan Engle’s script works overtime to keep so many plot strands dangling and still find an amusingly unsophisticated way to tie them all together right at the very end. They take this Hitchcockian premise to its breaking point only to bolt right past it as things literally explode around Michael and the remaining commuters, in the process crafting the illusion that the audience has no idea what is going to happen next when in reality the answers are so blatantly obvious it’s almost as if they weren’t being concealed at all.

Collet-Serra has always been a technically proficient filmmaker, The Shallows a perfect example of him utilizing every single one of his skills with precision, confidence and tenacity. While not at the top of his game, he still handles himself admirably here. In fact, Collet-Serra stages one elongated bit of fisticuffs between Michael and a mysterious passenger inside an empty train carriage that’s extraordinary, if for no other reason than to wonder where the cuts are and when Neeson’s stuntman was inserted to do the things the actor wouldn’t be physically able to accomplish himself. He and editor Nicolas De Toth (Stoker) do a fine job creating tension while also maintaining a frenetic, if still pleasantly naturalistic, pace, the film’s 105-minutes flying by far more quickly than I imagined they were going to when I stepped inside the theatre. Also worthy of mention is Roque Ba?os’s (Evil Dead) invigorating score, and even if one major action sequence the music reminded me of Mark Mancina’s classic Speed theme, the composer’s compositions still manage to become their own character working inside the movie with the same tenacity and fervor Neeson is.

None of which is my way of saying that The Commuter is some sort of January marvel we’ll be talking about for the remainder of 2018. Be that as it may, Neeson and Collet-Serra know what they’re doing and they’ve got the formula down pat. For fans of the pair, there are certainly far worse ways to spend a couple of hours. If anything, the movie sure beats getting stuck in rush hour traffic on the way home from work. Make of that what you will."
 82/100,,Piers Marchant," January 12, 2018","Back in the '80s, the joke went, you never wanted to invite Angela Lansbury to your home for any reason: Wherever she went, someone was always getting murdered. With that in mind, consider the plight of poor Liam Neeson, hunky sexagenarian from Northern Ireland, who has oddly morphed into a well-aged action hero over the last decade.

Since 2008's execrable Taken, Neeson's characters have awakened from comas to find no one knows who they are anymore; survived in the wilds of Alaska after a plane crash and done battle with a pack of wolves; been forced to shoot his way out of trouble on a plane in midflight after receiving texts that the passengers will be executed; been forced on the lam all night long in trying to save his son from an angry mob boss; and, of course, defended virtually every member of his family and his estranged wife several times over from would-be human traffickers.

Neeson has carved out a solid decade of high-concept, moderately budgeted action fare largely on the strength of his everyman persona. He doesn't mess with sci-fi stuff, or anything involving fantastical elements -- he leaves that kind of thing to Tom Cruise -- his action films have been grounded in the day-to-day, which makes this, er, vehicle more or less in perfect keeping with his branding: Michael (Neeson), a long retired ex-cop turned insurance agent, on the day he is laid off, gets propositioned to make $100K by a stranger who calls herself Joanna (Vera Farmiga) on his regular commuter train just to identify a mysterious passenger on the train and insert a GPS responder in that passenger's bag.

Initially, he doesn't believe the offer, but shortly after Joanna exits the train, he goes to retrieve the packet of money, exactly as she described. With virtually no idea of what he's meant to do or why, he hesitates to take anything further, until it is made clear to him that he's being monitored at every turn and his wife and sons are in mortal danger if he doesn't do exactly what is asked of him.

Eventually, Michael gets more and more hysterical in the search for the elusive passenger known only as ""Prin"" (intentionally misspelled to preserve the mystery), attempting to loop his former partner (Patrick Wilson) into the situation, oddly interrogating everyone including a young ticket taker (Adam Nagaitis), an obnoxious yuppie broker (Shazad Latif), and a scared nurse (Clara Lago), and getting more and more confused as to the conspiracy that has been so carefully orchestrated around him.

So carefully orchestrated, it must be said, that the bevy of screenwriters credited for the caper, have crafted yet another thriller which involves a nefarious plan so meticulously organized and prearranged, with everything timing out perfectly in every way, it becomes pretty clear early on it would have been much, much easier and more efficient to actually just dispatch a single, trained assassin to do the work instead. As the story gets more embroiled, it becomes less coherent and amusing, climaxing as it does with a massive train derailment, a hostage situation, and a final bit of flimflammery that's truly just nonsensical.

Still, it's a far cry less appalling than Neeson's vicious, retired super-agent in the Taken films, and holds together at least somewhat better than some of his other mystery thrillers. Director Jaume Collet-Serra, reuniting with Neeson after the pair made several of these action flicks, including Unknown and Non-Stop, actually constructs a reasonably taut first act, where the details of each passenger flitting past us might actually turn out to be relevant later on.

There are a handful of moments, such as when Michael identifies a seemingly insignificant detail (whether someone is right-handed or not) and uses it to hone in on his quarry, where the film gets buoyed up slightly beyond its preposterous premise. It also takes its sweet time in the beginning, getting us onto the train with a series of well-edited jump cuts over what is meant to be the many years Michael has spent tooling to and from the city for his job, like every other schnook in a suit and tie, hoping to last long enough to make retirement.

If the film too quickly builds into hysteria -- at one point, with Michael fighting for his life, crawling out from under a moving locomotive, and discovering a dead body under the train, it occurred to me that the entire far-fetched enterprise might just be some sort of ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" scenario, triggered because he was so miserable to have to tell his wife about being laid off, but alas, that proved overly optimistic -- at least it takes a few minutes to ground its protagonist. Early in the film, trying to convince a young married couple to buy life insurance, he tells them the story of how he and his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) had scrimped and saved to build up their retirement portfolios only to have the mortgage meltdown of 2008 wipe everything away.

In fact, the film works pretty hard to make Michael as likable as possible -- the only reason he even considers taking the woman's assignment is because he got laid off and his oldest son is about to embark upon an expensive, private college education. He's a man of the people, who only wanted to do the right thing as a cop, which is why he finally couldn't take it anymore. He's so squeaky clean, when he's first approached by Joanna, he holds up his wedding band and gently informs her he's married, just so there's no confusion (like Mike Pence with a strong right hook).

Initially, the woman pitches the plan to Michael as a kind of ethical hypothetical: If you had the chance to make a lot of money by doing something seemingly insignificant to a complete stranger, would you do it? The film isn't written carefully or craftily enough to actually consider that question. You would need a much heavier Hitchcockian influence for that sort of thing, but I guess we can give it a golf clap or two for trying."
 B-,,Eric D. Snider," January 12, 2018","If it’s January, Liam Neeson must be punching people (or wolves). In “The Commuter,” directed by regular Neeson wrangler Jaume Collet-Serra (“Non-Stop,” “Run All Night”), the people who need punching are on the evening train from Manhattan to Poughkeepsie, which insurance man and former police officer Michael MacCauley (Neeson) rides every single day and usually does not have to punch anyone. On this occasion, however, he is approached by a beautiful, enigmatic woman named Joanna (Vera Farmiga), who eventually establishes the scenario: Michael must find a certain person on the train and get that person’s bag. Michael will be paid $100,000 for this. Joanna doesn’t mention any consequences if Michael chooses not to take the job, but once she’s off the train he learns that his wife and son are in danger, because of course they are. Better get punchin’!

So it’s that kind of movie: a pulpy, mildly intense potboiler where a man is forced to perform tasks while under constant (some might say impossible) surveillance, receiving messages and instructions at crucial points in a manner indicating extraordinary (some might say impossible) planning among multiple conspirators. And it’s pretty good at being that kind of movie! The screenplay (by first-timers Byron Willinger and Philip de Blasi, with rewrites by “Non-Stop” polisher Ryan Engle) keeps us in the dark with Michael, gradually revealing who’s behind all this, what’s in the bag, and what the cops played by Patrick Wilson and Sam Neill in one early scene have to do with it. Michael’s police instincts kick in; he’s on this commuter train every day, so he knows which passengers aren’t usually here and are therefore potential suspects. He has to interact with his usual commuter buddies without letting on that anything is amiss. When everything is over, a passenger says, “Next time, I’m takin’ the bus!” You know. That kind of movie.

It eventually gets a bit too preposterous, going off the rails (get it?) as the conspiracy gets wilder and wilder. As is often the case, we come to realize that the villains’ plan was far more elaborate and complicated than it needed to be, though of course that’s part of the fun. Collet-Serra keeps the camera moving, swooping and swirling between train cars and through windows, doing impossible things to hold our attention while Michael punches his way to justice in a respectably forgettable, good-while-it-lasts action thriller."
,‘The Commuter’ Begs the Question: Is Liam Neeson Getting Too Old for This Sh*t?,Nick Schager," January 12, 2018","As a lifelong Metro-North patron who’s presently writing this review while on the train back home from Manhattan, I can confidently pronounce The Commuter to be the most realistic film ever made about the hell that is commuting.

To be sure, Jaume Collet-Serra’s thriller doesn’t get the details of day-to-day New York City railway travel right―the next time I feel comfortable getting down on my hands and knees in a train bathroom (as Liam Neeson’s hero does) will be the first time, by which I mean the last time, since performing such an act would immediately cause me to catch the plague. Nonetheless, the litany of logistical errors found in this breakneck action saga have little bearing on its overarching verisimilitude, given how forcefully it conveys the nightmarish agony experienced by anyone, and everyone, forced to shuttle back and forth from the suburbs to the city for work. It’s a fantasy when it comes to its subject’s specifics, and a documentary when it comes to its spirit.

The Commuter is the fourth collaboration between Collet-Serra and his favorite leading man Neeson, and as with their airborne Non-Stop and the director’s Blake Lively-versus-a-shark The Shallows, it’s an exercise in suspenseful constriction, involving an everyperson dealing with extraordinary circumstances set in a confined physical space. In this case, that protagonist is Michael MacCauley, a former cop who for the past 10 years has dragged himself out of bed each morning at 6 a.m. to put on a suit and tie, chat in the kitchen with his wife (Elizabeth McGovern) and son (Dean-Charles Chapman), and take the morning locomotive from Tarrytown to the Big Apple to sell life insurance. It’s a routine life that allows Michael to scrape by―if just barely. And it’s no sooner established by Collet-Serra via a concise opening credit sequence than it’s torn apart when Michael is unceremoniously fired. A couple of beers later with old partner Alex Murphy (Patrick Wilson), and he’s headed back home to have an unpleasant conversation with his spouse.

Collet-Serra shoots inside and outside Grand Central Terminal, but in most other respects, The Commuter’s portrait of Michael’s to-and-fro journey is the stuff of Hollywood make-believe. His train’s cars boast tables across which friendly men and women sit. Passengers know each other (and their regular ticket-takers) by name. Everyone is pleasant and chatty―or, in the case of an obnoxious investment banker, openly censured by those sitting nearby. And then there are the aforementioned spotless bathrooms: a dead giveaway that no one involved in this film has ever been forced to use one of those cramped, soiled hot boxes during a bumpy rush-hour trip. That Michael’s train route also features a number of non-existent stops (86th and Lexington?), and his vehicle features floor hatches big enough to store dead bodies, are simply further examples of the proceedings’ unnecessary―if amusingly goofy―fancifulness.

When it comes to fantasticality, of course, nothing about The Commuter beats the sight of Neeson gamely continuing to strike a grizzled badass pose. Initially presented as a sad-sack victim of corrupt corporate villainy (as he tells the sleazy banker, “On behalf of the American middle class: Fuck you!”), Neeson’s MacCauley is given the chance to prove his good-guy credentials when, on his return train ride, Joanna (Vera Farmiga) sits across from him and gives him a hypothetical question: Would you carry out a single act that has no effect on you, and only has ramifications for a stranger, for $100,000? That query, MacCauley learns, isn’t in fact theoretical, as he’s quickly embroiled in a secretive mission to find an unfamiliar passenger and plant a GPS tracker on their bag before they get off at the Cold Springs station.

As this assignment soon leads to fisticuffs, gunplay, and worse, one half-expects the 65-year-old Neeson to channel Danny Glover and declare, “I’m getting too old for this shit!” Especially in the late going, when the actor’s face is consistently, and awkwardly, CGI-grafted onto a stunt double’s body, The Commuter feels like confirmation that―after a decade of making sturdy B-movies like Taken, Unknown, and Run All Night―the star has gotten a bit too long in the tooth for such beat-’em-ups. And yet before MacCauley finally kicks righteous ass and saves the day (yeah, yeah, spoiler alert), Collet-Serra at least nods to his headliner’s advanced age, especially in an initial brawl that finds MacCauley primarily on the receiving end of a whupping courtesy of a younger adversary.

Byron Willinger, Philip de Blasi, and Ryan Engle’s script balances such physical clashes with a healthy dose of panicked-wronged-man mystery, making the film play like a cross between Strangers on a Train and Die Hard (or Non-Stop on Rails). Collet-Serra has a brisk, confident style that keeps exposition to a reasonable minimum and only gets showmanship-y on special occasions―in this case, a faux-single-take fight scene that’s too herky-jerky by half, and a digitally enhanced reverse zoom through the train that captures an authentic sense of its cars’ crowded, cluttered, noisy atmosphere. As in much of his prior work, the director knows how to make no-nonsense genre material hum, keeping the pace propulsive and the combat frequent while also granting his lead enough time to color his character in nuanced shades.

Alas, the same can’t be said for the rest of the cast. Literally phoning in much of their performances, Wilson and Farmiga merely appear on-screen early and late, which makes it seem like they wandered in from some The Conjuring sequel filming nearby. Sam Neill and Better Call Saul’s Jonathan Banks are given even shorter shrift as, respectively, MacCauley’s old boss and his cheerily pessimistic commuting buddy. And Florence Pugh, so magnetic in last year’s Lady Macbeth, is barely recognizable or utilized as a tattooed and pierced teenager who totes around a backpack full of contraband and utters only a few meager lines amidst the mounting chaos.

In its squandering of so many talented actors, and its inexplicable refusal to indulge in cheesy one-liners (where’s my “Your ticket has been punched!” send-off?!), The Commuter proves something of a missed opportunity: a chance to really enrich a daffy premise with some scenery-chewing personality. As it stands, it’s an efficient, diverting new entry in Neeson’s ongoing action canon, albeit one which suggests his He-Man career route has finally―cue ’90s-era zoom into close-up!―reached the end of the line.

,,Robert Denerstein," January 12, 2018",
 1/5,,Matthew Lickona," January 12, 2018","The opening may have you wondering if you’ve walked into the wrong theater as it presents the same household morning scenario again and again with minimal variation: is this some kind of arty drama about the perils of middle-class existence? Nah, it’s just director Jaume Collet-Serra playing around with a pretext of context before he puts Liam Neeson through his violent paces for a fourth time, swapping out Non-Stop’s plane for a commuter train and tossing in some financial anxiety for motivation. It’s fun for a while, as Neeson’s ex-cop starts to shake off 10 years of insurance work and get back to his real self: observant, resourceful, and inhumanly tough. (Go ahead, knock him silly as many times as you like. He’ll be right as rain in two ticks.) The mystery is less a whodunit than a whogotit, the “it” being a bag containing something stolen that the owner is desperate to recover. If you don’t think too hard about why Neeson gets brought in or how the baddies operate or what the point is, you may be able to enjoy yourself. At least until the final act, when the film goes off the rails. Like a train might do. 2018."
,The Commuter Is Exactly What You’d Expect ―?and Better Than You Need,Emily Yoshida," January 12, 2018","Does it sound na?ve to say that I didn’t realize The Commuter would be so intensely about trains? Jaume Collet-Serra’s most recent Liam Neeson (literal) vehicle perhaps one-ups the plane in Non-Stop in its specificity, aside from the fake train logo and a few erroneous track changes for what is supposed to be an MTA North to Poughkeepsie. (It stops at the 86th and Lexington stop before surfacing, can you imagine?) Never have I seen the zone-code punch-out on commuter-rail ticket tabs featured so prominently and even glamorously on the big screen, and I am grateful their moment has come.

Neeson is Michael MacCauley this time around, an ex-cop turned insurance salesman whom his boss refers to as a “good soldier” before firing him seemingly without warning. MacCauley is five years from retirement, and he’s supposed to send a check that day for his son’s college tuition, plus three or four other factors that give him motivation to retrieve $100,000 from a train-car lavatory when a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga) tells him it’s there waiting for him. It may be a few reasons too many, but watching a film like The Commuter creak and latch its stakes into place is half the joy of watching it. MacCauley is a bit more of a milquetoast figure than previous Neesons, anyway, perhaps he needs more prodding before he starts stalking the aisles with bloody fists. In a frankly brilliant intro that composites thousands of morning routines and commutes and kisses good-bye to his wife (Elizabeth McGovern), Collet-Serra actually makes an effort to feel the concept of the increasingly abstract “everyday middle-class working man who’s just trying to do the right thing.”

MacCauley’s mission, as given to him by Farmiga, is to find someone on the train who “doesn’t belong,” and can only be identified by the fact that they’re getting off at Cold Spring and they’re carrying a bag. (In addition to actually being about an actual train, The Commuter is very much about being an actual commuter; MacCauley’s intimate and banal knowledge of his train and the people on it becomes his superpower.) He has no idea at first why Farmiga or whoever she’s working for wants to identify this person, but luckily this is one of those omniscient “nice shirt you’re wearing”Ctype organizations that can kill off people he cares about at the drop of a hat should he not comply with their wishes, and soon he starts to get an idea of what’s at stake. It’s not long before he catches on to the fact that he might be on the wrong side of things, but he can’t back out because They Have His Wife and Son, Goddammit!

The action escalates, with Neeson nervously traversing the length of the train enough times to either look like a terrorist himself or someone at extreme risk of deep vein thrombosis. It stays primarily mano a mano, but isn’t that the fun of these Neeson films? The human-scale intimacy of both their violence and their stakes? This isn’t to say that the humans in The Commuter act anything like real people; the train is the most realistic performer here, but you could do a lot worse. The Commuter is a completely harebrained puzzle box that could have quickly flitted off into utter nonsense land. But the way it embraces its mundanity ― as well as the fact that Neeson may very well in fact be getting too old for this shit ― makes it surprisingly tactile, and more memorable than it needs to be."
 C-,Unconvincing ‘Commuter’ goes off rails,James Verniere," January 12, 2018","Half “The Lady Van?ishes,” half “The Girl on the Train,” films don’t come much dumber or more aimed at only the most gullible audiences than “The Commuter,” a film the great Liam Neeson, who has made many slightly superior efforts of this kind, should have passed on."
