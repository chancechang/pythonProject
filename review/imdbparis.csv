5.0 / 10,re-telling their own story,David Ferguson,9 February 2018,Warning: Spoilers
5.0 / 10,Nowhere Near Clint Eastwood's Best,neener3707,9 February 2018,"While it doesn't come close to Clint Eastwood's best films, I still definitely enjoyed this story of life and bravery., but some will find the film too slow and just waiting for the thwarted terrorist attack. We all know the story, 3 Americans stop an attempted terrorist attack aboard a train to Paris, but the film is almost barely about that, its more of story about their lives and what led them to their destiny. I only really sort of didn't like the acting, which I will discuss later, but for the most part I had no issues with this film, which is not over-patriotic flag waving propaganda like many anti-military Liberals will say it is. Its a story about the lives of men as well as when bravery is forced upon average citizens.First off, about the acting, the Americans didn't do the best job, but that is understandable because these are not actors, but the real men who were there. So its very clear that they are untrained actors, even with the help of veteran actor Clint Eastwood. The story was well put together, chronicling the lives of the heroes in question. Though some of the touching an emotional conversations are bit cheesy, which is surprising coming from Clint Eastwood but it goes by quickly and ws no real issue. But over all I thoroughly enjoyed this film, even with its slight flaws that honestly only bothered me slightly.I would recommend it."

3.0 / 10,Watch this to renew your appreciation for professional actors!,ryanlaurencecole,11 February 2018,"Going into this I didn't have high expectations. If you haven't heard, the ""stars"" of the film aren't actors. They are the guys who actually lived the story. I knew this going into the film, and I was still shocked at how jarring an experience it was to watch regular guys act on the big screen. Don't get me wrong, I certainly couldn't do any better. Not to mention, I haven't done anything in my life anyone should make a movie about. So why did I see this? Well I have moviepass and had nothing to do on a Saturday at noon. So here we are. Unless you are in a similar situation I would recommend you pass."
3.0 / 10,Clint Eastwood butchers an incredible story of courage and heroism.,Drew Ward (akwsixers10),11 February 2018,"To begin with, the three men who performed this act of courage deserve all the praise and honor they have received. They stood brave in the face of evil and terrorism and managed to prevent disaster.With that aside, this is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. There is a scene that takes place in early on in the film that features posters of two of Eastwoods earlier works, Jersey Boys and Letter from Iwo Jima, as well as Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. My advice, spend your money renting one of those movies before shelling out the money for a movie ticket for this latest hiccup in Eastwood's otherwise remarkable filmography. It starts with acting and to put it simply, it's just abysmal. Right from the start, the children playing the young heroes just aren't at the quality of what you would expect. The wooden writing doesn't help and plagues the film with countless cringe moments throughout its runtime. Then we move to the heroes themselves, who would have been better served working as consultants for the film to ensure authenticity. They simply aren't good, and nearly every line they delivered was met with a few chuckles from the nearly capacity crowd at my showing. Even if the three were replaced with trained actors, it's hard to see how that would substantially improve the product. The film acts more like a buddy adventure movie for the better part of it's runtime, rather than the heroic thriller that was being advertised. It's incredibly misguided and marks an unfortunate low point in Clint Eastwood's remarkable career. You are better served reading an account of the event than wasting time and money on this dud of movie. A few stars go to the admittedly tense train sequence that serves as the basis for the film and commitment to authenticity that seems to have been maintained based on press tour comments from the actors. 3/10 - Very Bad"
10.0 / 10,Loved the idea....true story & actual heroes instead of overpaid actors!,howardbooher,17 February 2018,"This movie wasn't really a 10, but it was pretty darn good & I used that rating to balance out some of the pathetic low ratings. Anyone who read about and watched the preview, let alone remembered the news story when this happened (I do), should not have been surprised. Honestly, the movie was exactly what we expected, and everyone in our group liked it. It was well done, going between the event (the attack) and flashbacks of a lifelong friendship among three friends. How else would anyone expect an event that probably only lasted a few minutes to last for an hour & a half movie UNLESS there was backstory added into the movie? Truthfully, anyone who expected a nonstop action flick needs to stop complaining about overpriced Hollywood films, actors, etc. & should just go watch an old action classic if that's all he/she wants. Was some of the acting a little stiff here and there? Yes, but these are real people, playing themselves, who acted heroically during a real event and avoided great tragedy for many, many people on that train. I was never bored, never yawned & truly enjoyed the well done back and forth pace of flashbacks between the attack and the paths that got them to that point. It's a little sad these days that a simply inspiring movie isn't good enough for a good review unless you have actors in it who make millions or tons of stuff gets blown up. I would much rather spend my money on a movie like this than on much of the other garbage that Hollywood puts out these days. I want movies to entertain, but to also be inspiring and not depressing or disgusting, and where the good guy wins. If you want to leave the theater feeling satisfied, this movie will not disappoint."

7.0 / 10,No flag waving hero stuff here.,maskedmovieman,8 February 2018,"Eastwood is never trivial or corny. This could have been an american flag waving hero film (some people see it that way anyway) but in fact it's about a normal guy that has been treated not so well in life by the authorities but at the end has his day and becomes what he always wanted to be: someone that saves lives. It's about life. Not flags. For example, it's interesting when the guys are corrected by the german tourist operator saying that Hitler was under attack by the Russians and NOT the Americans when he killed himself. You can't always be the hero when evil is defeated. I don't see flag waving here."

9.0 / 10,A victory against terror - enjoyed this thoroughly.,phd_travel,9 February 2018,"For those who criticize the non action parts of the movie miss the point. This movie is about ordinary people who had to deal with an extraordinary situation. The events only took minutes so of course it isn't a non stop action movie. It was a good thing to use the actual people as much as possible the three from Sacramento and the other from Virginia played themselves. It didn't have a reality TV feel - it actually helped make things much more real - not just some famous actors in perilous situations and there is nothing wrong with their acting. The parts showing the training of Stone were useful for the way he tackled the terrorist later and helped the shooting victim so it wasn't wasted. I actually enjoyed their trip through Rome, Venice, Berlin and Amsterdam. Their dialog was so much like any person who has done the Eurailpass thing would recognize. Showing their happy times helps emphasize the beauty and good times that still exist in Europe A couple of faults - the ceremonial speech at the end by Hollande could have had subtitles. The real footage was cleverly blended with the reenactments. The childhood school bonding is cute but the getting in trouble and visits to the principal's office could have been shortened a bit. Whatever it is it didn't have a Clint Eastwood draggy feeling at all.So good to see a real terrorist situation that turned out okay."
4.0 / 10,Nonsense,craciunescua,12 February 2018,"If I were Clint Eastwood I would apologise to all my cast for making them say the most redundant, artificial, uninspired and annoying dialog lines ever written. Yes, I mean Tommy Wiseau at least would have made it funny by their absurd quality; This was just frustrating borderline with stupid. This movie is the winner of ""I have no idea how to carry on the story in a coherent and visual way, therefore I'll explain everything in words, sometimes uttered by random, irrelevant characters that come out of nowhere and depart in the same manner"".
Cheers for the first hour of redundant and childish so called background development that makes absolutely no impact on the movie and probably would have made the entire product better if simply cut.
Long gone the days of ""Unforgiven"", ""Mystic river"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima""... do yourself a favour, see Jumanji instead."
1.0 / 10,Terrible Movie,oneill2424,11 February 2018,"Clint Eastwood's effort to pay tribute to these incredible heroes did not succeed. The script was terrible, the three main guys (the real heroes) cannot act one iota, and the film was filled with lots of empty meaningless space. The last 10 minutes were the best thing about the movie. That's when the heroes came alive and made an impact. I don't want to disparage these guys in any way, but this movie was just awful. If this is the kind of thing that Clint is doing is his advanced years, he needs to retire."
3.0 / 10,"Not Unforgiven, but ""Unforgivable""",rogerdodger1954,11 February 2018,"Firstly, my take is not meant to diminish the heroism these guys displayed on the day of the attack at all. They went above and beyond at great personal peril, and should be commended. Having said that... they can't act a lick! The worse part is, the guy who is the worse actor has the biggest role. Watching him act was like watching a grade school production of hamlet, if that schools production entire main cast was out with the flu and it was put on by the much less talented booger nose eating stand-ins. However, it wasn't just the bad acting (although that was a big part), the movie itself meandered with scenes which I'm still trying to find any possible meaning behind, except for helping to fill the time. I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, but his skills at directing and storytelling were not enough to save this turkey of a movie."
5.0 / 10,"Good story, Not enough for a whole film",noahhibdonlhhs,10 February 2018,Warning: Spoilers
1.0 / 10,One of the worst 'true event' films ever made.,punishable-by-death,8 February 2018,"After American Sniper- a true story about a man who is known only for the amount of people he killed on the battleground- one could be forgiven for thinking that Mr. Eastwood had gotten his jingoistic kink out of his system. This proves to be far from the case, and it would also seem that in a short amount of time he has lost all ability to make a remotely entertaining, cohesive, even interesting film after 2016's extremely solid Sully.We begin by meeting three US friends, narration telling us that they are the best of friends, before a quick description of each, which could honestly describe almost any person on a certain day.Oddly, there is a jump at least a decade back, where the three met in school, where they go to college, among other filler that could easily have the viewer wondering if they had walked into the wrong theatre. These exhaustive and pointless efforts to try and humanise the characters all fail miserably; the net result: faint, blurred caricatures of young males that we don't care about. Two of them, eventually, end up in the military.After this near-pointless introduction, one that easily takes up over half the film, if not three quarters, the two soldiers and their other friend, roped into a trip to Europe, finally decide to board the ill-fated train to Paris. Don't fear though, there are more baffling, irrelevant scenes beforehand when the trio first arrive in Europe, so you'll have time for a toilet break.As for the scenes on the train, a description of underwhelming is being far, far too kind. Not only are some scenes extremely hard to believe and the little amount of action haphazardly shot and hard to follow, the time spent on-board the train is a maximum of fifteen minutes. The train that is the title of the film.Subsequently, the overall result plays out like a poorly executed coming-of-age story with some tacky action scenes stapled roughly onto the end, sharp edges and all.As if none of this were bad enough, we have the predictable The US can conquer all 'theme' looming overhead. To be fair, there aren't any non-US people being demonised. But apart from some lip service that is easily missed, the incredibly short time spent on the train is spent focused on the three Americans.The biggest problem with the latter is that these scenes take at least half of the passengers who helped halt the situation out of the equation. Yes, two of the Americans were trained by the military and, perhaps, deserve more screen-time. But, according to reports of the averted disaster, the first three to react and help with the the threat were two Frenchmen and one British citizen, followed by the three we actually see do all the heavy lifting on-screen. I think this says more than you need to know about this atrocity of a film. Hang up the gloves Clint. For both our sanity. This has no redeeming qualities at all."
9.0 / 10,VERY GOOD MOVIE,boliarnaud,8 February 2018,"00 mostly comprised of banal, drama-free, quotidian scenes that merely reinforce the men's status as regular Joes who, one day, had the opportunity for greatness thrust upon 03Yeah at first I wasn't convinced by this movie but then I realized it was more than that, more than meets the eye so to speak, we're supposed to see a lifestyle, western, European-american opposed to this... barbarian stupid integrist muslimish lifestyle. We don't see him before the ""incident"" but we know at first sight for sure he's a bad guy, violent and obsessed by his own insanity. We see them (2 white guys and one black dude) smiling, enjoying life, they travel through Europe and then they travel to Paris...
Funny thing, Paris has a bad reputation but we don't know why (in fact we all know why). French people are rude. 
The bad guy is the only un-civilized person we see. Everybody else is fine, living their lives and the bad guy is obviously (like we say in Frane) ""un gros rageux"".
Full of hate that is.People just don't get it.Very good flick."
1.0 / 10,The worst movie I have ever seen,jackhannath,11 February 2018,"Don't get me wrong, I think the purpose and meaning behind the movie is great - everything else however wasn't.Between the real life people playing their own characters, a majority of scenes with no substance and contributing nothing to the underlying story, along with the first 80 minutes being drawn out for 10 minutes of the actual story at the very end.Save the money, and the time - you'll be grateful you did."
2.0 / 10,So disappointing,tlarraya,10 February 2018,"We went to see this at the cinema without reading any reviews because all Clint Eastwood07s movies so far have been amazin, but this was a huge let down. It07s amateurish and there is barely any story to tell. Really bad."
5.0 / 10,VIEWS ON FILM review of The 15:17 to Paris,viewsonfilm.com,9 February 2018,Warning: Spoilers
4.0 / 10,A Profound Disappointment,jamesbigham,10 February 2018,"Having seen and enjoyed Sully and knowing the extent of director Clint Eastwood's ability, I was very disappointed with this movie.After seeing the trailer, I imagined that the story would be mostly centered on the attack and preceding events, with occasional flashbacks into the characters lives to reinforce their individual personalities and beliefs . I also thought that there would be more insight into the terrorist, and the passengers. Instead the story begins when the main characters are in middle school. It then dwells at that age for about a quarter of the movie, depicting their irregular childhood's and blossoming friendship. I believe this part of the film is quite unnecessary; as it really doesn't add very much to the story. As the characters move into adulthood, the storyline remains somewhat bland without any real major plot themes being developed. Other than their remaining friendship, and two of the characters joining different branches of the military; which would give them added skills in the areas of weapon disarmament and the treatment of arms related wounds, this section too is much to long and it is quite boring.When the characters finally get to Europe, the scenes are long with very little speaking; it is, as a reviewer said above ""like watching from a home movie of someone you don't knows vacation"".There is also a scene in a Amsterdam nightclub, which should be totally unacceptable in a PG13 movie, and doesn't add anything to the tone or character of the movie.The scenes of the attack are very short and not very well developed, the aftermath is hardly shown, and you don't get any of the other passengers point of view. Also I find that the choice to use the actual heroes and not actors backfires, as they do not convey emotion and feeling as well as professionals would have done.
I also would wished for a end note detailing the current lives of the heroes and the fate of the victim; and what happened to the terrorist.All in all this is a very good story, with many great lessons and themes, but it falls very short, and I think I got just as much out of the trailer as I did the movie."
4.0 / 10,A Marmite film,elljay234,9 February 2018,"Judging by the rather unusual score distribution so far:27% 10 stars, 13% 5 stars, 18% 1 stars...you'll either love this film or like me wonder why you spent 90 minutes watching it. It's technically fine, the parts are played fine, but the plot doesn't really add much to what you already know about the story from the news reports at the time before going into the cinema. The three Americans did the right thing when it mattered, so the medals and thanks are most definitely well deserved, but the story is only told from their point of view which makes the film disappointingly one dimensional."
1.0 / 10,Very slow and disappointing...,dholdefer,10 February 2018,I realized about halfway through this movie that nothing was happening; I was just watching a documentary home movie of 3 kids growing up in America and it was not very interesting. There was no dramatic action until the last 10 minutes; no suspense or background of the terrorist leading to train trip. Characters were on a Europe vacation through 25% of the movie with no action. It was just a boring movie. We came home and watched Waco and Strike Back at home and TV was much better than this dull movie. Clint Eastwood's worst film to date...
10.0 / 10,Eastwood never disappoints,Takethispunch,9 February 2018,"A real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a high-speed railway ride. In the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on a train bound for Paris-an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe."
6.0 / 10,The 15:17 to Paris (2018),rockman182,12 February 2018,"I'm very mixed on Clint Eastwood's filmography especially in recent years. He is responsible for some great work from behind the camera but that hasn't really been the case in recent years. The 15:17 to Paris looked a bit bland and like a run of the mill affair when it comes to recreation of recent global events in film. It didn't help that critics weren't too pleased but of course, I then remembered that I never listen to critics. I'll tell you, the film is flawed and has slow passages but I liked it more than I thought I would.The film is based on the real life events about a train that had a terror attack foiled on its way from Amsterdam to Paris. The attack was stopped primarily by three men who were best friends growing up. One of them attempts to join the military and the film focuses on his trials to make it in the military, his relationship with his friends, and his quest to find out what his purpose is and how he can truly save some lives.The first note that needs to be made about the film is that the three lead actors cast in the film are the actual three who acted during the real life incident. With that however, comes a loss in quality of acting in the film. I get that Eastwood wanted to go with an authentic element by having the guys who lived it tell the story, but you could just tell that these weren't actors as they weren't always convincing or delivering lines properly. The film does spend an extended amount of time going into backstory as well which a times was quite noticeable.Otherwise, I enjoyed it. Some of the cinematography and locations (especially when the cast is on vacation) is gorgeous. The last twenty minutes or so are quite intense and satisfying. The event was something that isn't enough to warrant an entire feature film so I get that we had to go off point. Was the film necessary? No. It is however better than some of the stuff I've seen from Eastwood in recent years so I'll take it.6.5/10"

1.0 / 10,Absolute crock.,raybey,9 February 2018,"I joined this site just to give a review of this film because i cant get my money nor time back. The story couldve been so interesting but Clint drags in from the start and it is very predictable, lots of unnecessary scenes just to ""fill in"". In short I couldve stared at a dog staring at the wall and it would have been more fun."
1.0 / 10,Clint is Almost 90...We Should Expect a Decline of Thought and Scope!,Bele Torso,9 February 2018,"My dad is 90 and he cannot process much more than what is in front of him. It's called age! Can we expect more from Mr Eastwood who has all the power and control and a reputation that says, ""I am in control, leave me alone!"" He hired non-actors to be featured in a major motion picture. Yes, Captain Phillips did the same, but not with the lead actors. When you hire Tom Hanks to handle the brunt of the load, you can use fill-ins who can do a great job, but is this the same here? Does it reflect a realism? Can non-actors really make a movie like this work in a Reality TV culture? Only the viewer can answer these questions. If this film is successful (it will not generate the steam as American Sniper) but if people like it it will reflect this American culture of divide. I predict half will love it and half will hate it. Welcome to the American political system. Time will tell..."
1.0 / 10,Truly the worst movie I've ever seen in a theater,kgkyzer,14 February 2018,"A group of non-actors combined with a script that may have(?) been written by the same group leads to 90 minutes of my life I would like back. The movie was basically a group biography coupled with a 5 minute event. It was so sad I couldn't look away, hoping Clint would eventually bring some kind of redemption to the 90 minute tragedy of a film. Spoiler: he didn't."
,Be prepared to check your watch regularly,rbpriceiv,10 February 2018,"If this movie was an experiment, it mainly failed. The movie drags on and on with pointless scenes and zero dramatic build-up. The real life characters-love their bravery and courage to be sure-are not exactly gripping actors. Clint should have left the acting to professional actors. This could have been so much better if the story had focused on the terrorist's path, maybe in parallel with the heroes. Their life story just wasn't remarkable or interesting. The last 5% of the movie was good, but this was a long road to a small house."
4.0 / 10,"Eastwood's worst movie yet. Slow, boring, and not enough material to make it a big screen movie.",cruise01,9 February 2018,"The 15:17 to Paris is a biographical thriller that feels like it was not needed or there was not much of a source material to even adapt that event into a film. It follows the three American friends Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos after having different paths with their lives. One going into survival training in the military, the other being in the army in Afghanistan, and the third just being at there home state. They decide to go backpacking touring the European countries from Italy to Germany. Then, the final tour going to Paris. They decide to take the train to the country. And that is when the life-changing event of a guy who was about to open fire at the train passengers was intervene with the three friends. What I like about the film was the concept of showing how these three friends came together. From going to a Christian school and getting in trouble. From them going on there own paths. All this was briefly shown. But at the same time, this was the downside of the film. From the dislikes of the film and this being Clint Eastwood's disappointing movie. Which he is slowly losing his taste of making good movies and one of his best was American Sniper. How much of this event can you really adapt into film? This movie extends the childhood backstory of the three kids. And there paths into the military. And them going on a European trip. And prolonged conversations about how something his pulling them into Paris for a greater purpose. It was a short event. The movie spends about ten minutes of it in the train. Even though, it is the title of the movie. The short action of this attack was only a few minutes. For anyone looking for action or thrills and suspense will be left disappointed. Cause the script working on this event can barely do so much. Our three heroes stepping in to stop this attack was a brave move. But it does not have enough material to warrant a movie about it. It is slow moving. Clint Eastwood's direction is getting dull and tedious. The script briefly goes over their childhood and young adult lives. I found this movie to be very boring. Using the real heroic Americans like Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos was trying to be true to the story. But there first time performances were stale and dull. Overall, The 15:17 to Paris was a bad movie. Plot was trying to be inspirational but fails to do so when the script lacked characterization and lacking in source material. Clint Eastwood is hitting the dead end with his films. They are becoming terrible through each one. It was boring and dull. And the performances were atrocious. I would not recommend the film. I ll say wait until it's a rental. It was not worth seeing a movie that had nothing exciting to see on the big screen.I rate the film 2 out of 5 stars."
4.0 / 10,"One hour and a half of nothing, and 5 minutes of action",johpinmo,16 February 2018,"You could delete several scenes from this movie and you will not feel any change, just a nonsense writing, full of boring scenes and irrelevant characters.It seems that the only purpose of this movie was to try to prolong a small scene that we all already knew how it would be."
3.0 / 10,Eastwood's worst work to date despite a great climactic sequence.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,13 February 2018,"The stand-out sequence really is (almost) as gripping and accomplished as anything Eastwood has ever produced, but it's just a shame that the rest of 'The 15:17 To Paris (2018)' is not only the ageing director's worst work to date by far, but also the worst film of the year yet - one that would take a fair failure to beat - and a peculiarly uncinematic experience which can only be described as a misstep in every possible direction. The majority of the piece is pointed towards the three real-life leads and purposefully portraying their unremarkable lives in an unremarkable way, with large chunks dedicated to tediously slow touristic holidays and nonchalantly unnecessary childhood chapters. The whole point of the picture is its eponymous train-ride's signifying event and that isn't even shown until ten-minutes before the end, by which point we're so bored and uninvested in the cardboard caricature versions of our non-actor heroes, that it's a real struggle to justify having sat through all the pointless filler (clearly included to scrape that all-important 90-minute mark) just to get there. 3/10"
,Sorry,infoservinc,12 February 2018,"This may not have been the worst movie I have ever seen but it is close. I feel sorry for the three ""Heroes"". What they did deserved better. Clint Eastwood is simply getting to old"
3.0 / 10,"Don't believe the trailers...this is definitely not an action filled movie, it's a terrible character development one.",beartoothweb,12 February 2018,"After seeing the trailers, I was excited to see an action-packed retelling of a great and heroic act. What a serious disappointment! We just watched the movie 13 Hours, which was an awesome retelling of that type of event.This movie is basically 1:45 of watching a mostly uninteresting story (at least the way it was told) of 3 guys, with about :15 minutes of ""artsy fartsy"" portrayal of what was a really heroic act.The kids were unbelievable and most of the dialogue was not age appropriate (not for the cursing, but rather for the way they spoke (like a 17 year old, not an 8-10 year old). The entire ""Europe"" act was a complete waste of time, and I found myself just wanting it to be over. By the time we get to the heroic scene, I could genuinely not care what happens next.The guys did a decent job for not pro actors, so that's a good point, BUT, it was so poorly written, it was painful to watch.Wait until you can stream it for free, definitely don't spend money on it. I should have gone to see Peter Rabbit instead. ;->"
,The worst of Eastwood,GUENOT PHILIPPE,7 February 2018,"He has reached the bottom of the barrel, as we say in France. Everybody on earth knows that American saved the world, and I have never forgotten what they did in Normandy, back in 1944. Never. Of course those two heroes who play their own characters here are rewarding for what hey did. But does that justify to make such an ultra patriotic crap? WHY did Eastwood refuse to use the same scheme Paul Greengrass did for UNITED 93? Remember that in this fantastic movie, we followed BOTH the heroes, passagers of the plane AND the terrorists? Here, in this garbage film, we see ONLY the Americans? 
 WHY? WHY? WHY? 
 Too many clichés here, a feature destined to dumbs, red necks and that's all. 
I know that Eastwood loves heroes, for instance his previous SULLY was superb, although we already knew the story, there was no suspense at all, like this one. But who cares? But I persist and sign, Eastwood could have done a far better film, and for a director like him, a film maker of his stature, that's unforgivable. 
 Get away from it;"
1.0 / 10,Patriotic crap,amedina-590-704752,12 February 2018,"Yes, it's a ""true story"" with the real participants but it's nothing more than a patriotic and boring crap. Clint Eastwood can do much more better as many of his previous films can probe."
9.0 / 10,As close to real life as it gets.,vlwtx,19 February 2018,"Real people don't have acting coaches, real life isn't one dilemma right after another, and real fights don't have choreographers.
I am so glad I didn't look at the ratings on this film (as I usually do) before going to see it. I haven't read the reviews and probably won't, as I think they might make me mad. If you want to see invincible heroes with superpowers, go see an Avengers film. This is about real people and their real reactions. Does ""Real"" mean ""imperfect""? Absolutely.
What I loved most about this film is that it doesn't get into the motives or life of the terrorist. Who cares what his motives were? His actions are what mattered.
The message I got from this film was this: When the time comes, will you have courage to make a difference, or will you hunker down and hope someone else does it for you?Go see this with an open mind."
3.0 / 10,Bad Acting and worse Bad Screenplay,siddharthkatragadda,13 February 2018,"The heroism of the real-life protagonists is undermined by understandably
poor acting - and a really bad script. I mean, this is a first time writer, I understand,
but looks like he/she hasn't even had a 101 class in screenwriting. It felt like 90%
of the scenes lacked character or plot development, and just meandered as a travelogue in Europe or an intro to Army life. This is why they say there are only 3 things most important in the film - script, script, script. Even a director like Clint Eastwood can't save a badly written script."

I am a reasonably intelligent adult and I disagree completely with the critics. In my view, the real-life heroes didn't need actors to help them subdue the terrorist and they didn't need actors to tell their story for them. These three young men performed remarkably, especially considering their lack of acting classes or Hollywood connections. Actually, in this situation, I don't need Hollywood's best on the screen; here I'm looking for a more human touch. As I watched the story unfold, I never felt the movie lacked in any way. In addition, I applaud Clint Eastwood for his bravery in bringing this act of heroism to the forefront, against much opposition from the entertainment industry. And shame on our media critics for their efforts to minimize this story. Note: check out Wikipedia if you want a better understanding of the 2015 Thalys Train Attack."

The soundtrack is like elevator music. I kept turning to my friend saying are we sure this is a Clint Eastwood film. I think he must have fell asleep in the directors chair. The professional actors were worse than the non-actors. I guess Clint won't be accused of Hollywoodizing it and embellishing on the story.

Overhyped End Clint Eastwood is back with another historical drama, in an attempt to tell our world events in a theatrical manner. The 15:17 to Paris is indeed a historical drama that is perhaps one of the most realistic films to come out this year. One gets to touch on aspects of the characters life, as the cinematography and sound editing bring this engaging story to life on the big screen. Unlike other historical films, this film moves at a quick pace to get you from one end to the other, eventually arriving at the final destination of the heroic deed. 
 However, Eastwood and team didn't have quite the magic they are known for. The movie's opening had me questioning how accurate the teachers' portrayals were and even more at how overexaggerated the acting was. However, the bigger disappointments were how incomplete the story felt, with various aspects dropped as they were building up and how disconnected the whole story felt. Throw in how the movie was primarily about one hero not three and the story only became less personalized than I had expected. When everything is said and done though... even the ending feels a little fizzled out, with the trailers again overhyping the majesty of the vent. 
 In summary, the 15:17 to Paris is a big budge documentary that chronicles the journey of our heroes in a manner that is realistic, to the point, and beautifully shot. However, I really expected more from Eastwood, primarily in stringing these men's lives together and really introducing them to the world. Sadly, a disjointed presentation and lackluster job of showing all three led this tale to be far blander than you might expect. Honoring the actors for a solid first try at acting, the movie is best left for home viewing in my opinion. "

4.0 / 10,5 minutes of plot stretched way too thin,Fletcher Conner,14 February 2018,"It was an interesting idea to tell this story with the real people who lived it. However, it was more an idea for a 30 minute TV special than a feature length movie. The movie is about them stopping a terrorist attack on a train, but that only takes 5 minutes so Clint Eastwood fills it out with a lot of very uninteresting backstory on the characters. They are ordinary people with ordinary lives, and that makes for very dull movies. I don't care about when they were in middle school or if they were clubbing in Amsterdam two days before the attack.As for casting the actual people to play themselves, it serves as a reminder of how difficult acting is. No offense to Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos, but they can't act. Almost every line sounds awkward and unrealistic because they aren't sure how to behave in front of the camera. The child actors are just as bad, which is typical of most child actors. The only people who feel natural in their roles are Judy Greer and Jenna Fischer, the professional actors.There were also several anachronisms that are minor complaints, but are mistakes that shouldn't be made. First, in the scenes from their childhood, set in 2005, there is a poster for Letters from Iwo Jima on Spencer's wall. The movie didn't come out until the end of 2006, given that it is Clint Eastwood's movie, he should get that right. Also, when Spencer decides to get in shape for the military (sometime in 2011 or 2012) they are watching a Cal football game from 2006. I wouldn't have noticed, except they mention Marshawn Lynch by name and have a shot of the game itself and the announcers can be easily heard during the scene. They had to go and find video of that game to show, so why didn't they pick a game that was from the year the scene was taking place."
3.0 / 10,"The scene that we all came to see is great, but unfortunately we have to endure over an hour of terribly written, awkwardly acted, completely boring and irrelevant scenes in o",domtaylor,13 February 2018,"Hiring the real life heroes to play themselves in this film was an interesting conceit, however it ultimately proved to be a terrible mistake, yet at no fault of the unprofessional actors. Director Clint Eastwood insisted that these men didn't train professionally as actors, in the hope of the film feeling realistic, but this backfired on the final piece as it actually ended up making the whole thing feel entirely false. Every line said in this film, including ones said by professionally trained actors, felt synthetic and completely destroyed the true to life diegesis that Eastwood was desperately aiming for. Surprisingly though, the acting isn't the worst thing in this film. The heroic event that the film is actually about only takes up around 10 minutes of screen time in this 94 minute feature. That scene itself is excellent. It is tense and exciting, and truly shows how brave these men were. Unfortunately, it is also the only good scene in the entire film. The preceding 70ish minutes, which show the lives of these men from their childhood to their adulthood, are painfully boring and completely irrelevant to the story. The problem is that the story could only fill around 10 minutes, which obviously isn't long enough for a feature film. Instead of being a short film, or even better a documentary, detailing the heroic actions on the train, we are forced to endure over an hour of terribly written, awkwardly acted, bland scenes about unimportant events that happened in the lives of these men, which leave you questioning why this film even exists. The worst offence is a sequence that takes up a large majority of the films screen time, in which we watch the men as they go about their business on the holiday that they took before they boarded the 15:17 to Paris. We see them doing extremely mundane and boring things such as getting ice cream, or talking to some random guy in a bar. None of these events are developing character, or building up tension to the eventual train sequence. It's as if we are being forced to sit through somebody else's slideshow of holiday snapshots wondering when it will end.Overall, 'The 15:17 to Paris' is an utter disaster. It's bland, boring, and entirely pointless. Thankfully the scene that we all came to see is good, but unfortunately it can't save this film from being a total misfire. 3/10."

,A different way of telling a story,Figgy66-915-598470,12 February 2018,"12 February 2018
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The 15:17 To Paris. If you go to watch this film expecting a real superhero story with lots of action, you will be very disappointed. Based on the true events of 21 August 2015 when a terrorist attack was thwarted by three Americans on board a train to Paris, this is a story more of friendship, growing up and selfless actions to save lives of others with no thought to themselves. Using the actual three men instead of actors, you get a real insight into their world and I had the feeling I was watching the contents of someone's diary, but not in a voyeuristic manner, more like being invited in to the story of someone's life. It was a refreshing way of telling the tale and although a little stilted in the dialogue sometimes I rather enjoyed it. There was little focus on the terrorist himself and rightly so. Ok the acting was not the greatest' and the story meandered a little but this served to emphasise how ordinary people leading ordinary lives can do extraordinary things. This is a story of true heroes!!"
3.0 / 10,"The three heroes from The 15:17 to Paris deserve more respect then this dull, laughably bad adaptation",RforFilm,14 February 2018,"We seem to be living in a world where there are more terrorist attacks. Regardless of why this is happening, it's important that people keep preparing themselves to take proper caution. How they do so is anyone's guess. The best bet is to not only identify where they can hide, but how they can get as far away from any attackers as possible. There are some that may be willing to fight off any potential terrorist, but this should only be reserved for expert survivors. What makes it difficult is that even if an attacker doesn't have a gun, their probably going to have another weapon like a knife. Because that most terrorists have weapons, few people are going to fight back. For three guys during one trip to Europe in 2015, they took a chance to save a train full of people. A terrorist had brought an semi automatic and several knives. Three Americans, Spencer Stone, Alex Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler, held him off, got everyone to move to the front of the train, and kept the attacker subdued until the train could stop. There is clearly a good story that needs to be told. It's too bad we got The 15:17 to Paris as a result. Growing up in Sacramento, Spencer Stone and Alex Skarlatos are two middle school boys who are obsessed with the military, war, and just playing around. When they prove to be troublemakers, their mothers instead have them going to a private Christian school where they continue to be trouble for their teachers. They eventually add a new student Anthony Sadler into the group as they continue to talk war, guns, and whatever makes them friends. Despite their struggles in school, their mothers stick up for them.When Spencer later meets a Marine recruiter, he decides to enlist in the Air Force, hoping to end up in the pararescue. His lack of depth perception prevents him from getting that, but ends up in another department. Alex has also joined, but is in the Middle East. On Skype, all three talk and decide to take a trip to Europe. They hit Germany, Italy, and Amsterdam and seem to have fun...that is until they get on that train where the terrorist attempts an attack. For The 15:17 to Paris, director Clint Eastwood has casted the original men from the historical event to reenact their heroism. It's a neat experiment that could add some realism into the scenario. The big question is whether these guys can act. Overall, all three guys, Spencer, Alex, and Anthony, can act enough to play themselves. Its just that the rest of the movie isn't that good...and it's not even the actors fault. Many of the films shortcomings is on the script which seemed to have trouble getting the story beyond the terrorist attack. Eastwood's previous film Sully showed that if you explore the personality of the hero and what it meant to the event, it can turn a small event into a big movie. The problem is that while it tries to do something similar to our three heroes, its fails really bad. The first half hour is on the boys when their children, which feels so chipper and campy, that I couldn't believe that Eastwood directed it. Once they become adults, much of the core emotional elements are replaced with Spencer applying with the military and...going through it with him. Even when the guys meet up to go to Europe, we never learn anything new about them. It's just like seeing vacation footage...and not even interesting footage. It's all just boring filler until we get to the train segment. We know that Clint Eastwood is more then capable of making stories about heroes; stories about true Americans who are risking everything to make everything safe. So how could he have made The 15:17 to Paris so dull? I've said before that the jumbled and poorly written script by newcomer Dorothy Blyskal is to blame. Instead of becoming an exploration of these three friends and their connection, everything plays out like a bad Christian movie; afraid of really exploring the issue in favor of making our guys look good. I'll give this one and a half European trains out of five. This isn't just a bad movie from Eastwood, but a shockingly bad film from him. I hope that the book this movie is based on is better. Because for a movie to take these heroes and make them this boring, I hope that this writer is reduced to writing for the worst TV show out there. This reenactment is nowhere close to real life."

This movie is just not exciting. Most of it is on the backgrounds of the 3 guys involved that stopped the terrorist. The actual train incident lasts for about 10 minutes in the movie. That is it. Most of the movie is on the guys childhoods and lives up until this point. At the end of the movie, it does not even give you an update on the idiot terrorist and what actually happened with him (For the record is legal case is still pending). UGH. Kinda wish I hadn't wasted my money on this."

And I could pretty much guarantee I would not be annoyed by other people in there.I can certainly see why it is not for everyone and at times the acting is not the greatest, but they are not professional actors and are more than adequate. In fact I have seen worse professional actors. The second act drags a bit with a lot of filler scenes, but I think the ly off is worth it. Clint should be applauded for having the none acting Experienced heroes portraying themselves. Certainly a bold move. There are some professional actors in there Thomas Lennon with Judy Greer and Jenna Fisher as two of the boys mothers too. All three child actors are decent too. I think Clint is always good at getting performances from children. I think it deserves to be seen as Clint knows how to direct and it's a true story featuring the real heroes."

4.0 / 10,A Harrowing Story that Didn't Translate Well to Screen,Thomas Drufke,19 February 2018,"The idea Clint Eastwood had to cast the real life heroes as themselves in The 15:17 to paris was a bold one, and likely one that few directors could make without serious pushback. It was an intriguing decision that filled me with more trepidation than it did anticipation. To me, you can't just throw non-actors into a film and expect them to carry the entire feature by themselves.As it turns out, that trepidation turned out to be fact. The real-life story of Spencer Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, and many brave others is extraordinary. The courage of so many people in a very stressful situation should be commended, but I didn't feel as though Eastwood gave the project his undivided attention this time around. Unlike the brilliantly poignant 'Sully' from 2016, The 15:17 to paris not only suffers from stagnant acting, but the screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal is among the most bland and stiff pieces of writing I've read/heard in years. Granted, I heard that the 3 main heroes were allowed to change around dialogue to fit their personalities more, which in theory is a great idea, but that doesn't necessarily translate to a feature film. In short, you can't expect a mass audience to understand or go along with the exact tone and delivery of lines you would have around your friends. I know mine wouldn't translate.The actual train sequence itself is thrilling and is undoubtedly something cinematic and visceral. But Eastwood wasn't able to elevate an entire script around such an exhilarating few minutes. It hurts me to have to rip an important story (and one that should be told), but I have to call it like it is. There's not much to see here, but my appreciation goes out to the real life heroes involved, we need more folks like you around the world.4.1/10"

6.0 / 10,Know what you're getting,bowmanblue,12 February 2018,"I have to confess I didn't research this film to any great extent before I sat down to watch it. However, the two things I did know - mainly courtesy of all marketing - was that it was based on the true story of three men who foil a terrorist attack on a train and that it was directed by Clint Eastwood. Both seemed like equally good reasons to watch the film. And - technically - both of those statements are correct. However, I guess because the promotional material seemed to focus so much on the 'terrorist attack' that I expected something more like 'Under Siege 2' or 'The Commuter' than what I got.The film starts off with the three Americans as young boys and shows us how they meet. First of all I wasn't that impressed with the acting ability of the boys and was quite pleased when this segment ended. Then we get our first glimpse of what's to come, i.e. something bad happening on a busy commuter train in Europe. And then we're back to the boys again. Only now they're young men and we see what they're doing once they've left education. Only we mainly just focus on one of the three. The other two seem to get relegated into secondary characters. Cue another flash-forward to the terrifying events on the train and we get back to the men travelling round Europe. Then the bit on the train happens. Then the film ends.Now, you may think I'm being quite cynical and scathing towards the film, but I did actually enjoy it. I just thought it was going to be something it wasn't. Once the child-actors are out of the way the adults take over and they're all decent enough heroes who you find yourself able to root for. Clint Eastwood's direction is nothing special, but it's functional approach works well with the subject matter, i.e. overly-stylish camerawork and effects would seem well over the top and out of place in this film.It's not a bad film, but I think any audience needs to know that what they're sitting down for is some sort of drama about regular guys (who then happen to get caught up in a terrorist attack). If you go in expecting 'Die Hard on a train' then you're going to leave thoroughly disappointed. It's a slow, character-driven piece that is deliberately underwhelming in order to show how real life terrorist attacks differ to the Hollywood representation. If you're in the mood for something slow, serious and with meaning then you should enjoy this."
,This is the 1st bomber of 2018,BasicLogic,13 February 2018,"I know the typical snail tempo that has become one of the trademark of Clint Eastwood directed movies, but this one, other than the usual snail-crawling tempo, the lousy screenplay has further eroded the already deadbeat directing of his latest product. A 15 minutes story padded up with lot of unnecessary flashbacks of this three regular dudes even with their childhoods background. If a movie was focus on a psycho, murderer or serial killer, the screenplay might have to tell something about his childhood, tracing back to reasons why a person would have reached a point to turn himself into a serial killer, a FBI profiler would have to be used to explain the whys and connect the dots. But what we got here are just three regular G.I. Joes, we couldn't care less about how they later would have become three accidental heroes on a train against a terrorist, a fellow passenger who was also a bomber. We don't want to know anything about these three guys backstories, just like we don't want to know the biography of that terrorist. Yet, Clint Eastwood would accept a lousy script that used about 2/3 of the whole movie jumping back to these three guys' families, friends and neighbors. But is these crappy background checks really necessary? The answer to most of us is: ""WHO CARES!!"""
6.0 / 10,"not particularly well-written or well-acted, but a fitting and entertaining tribute to real-life heroes",Dave McClain,10 February 2018,"""The 15:17 to Paris"" (PG-13, 1:34) is a true story, with the three actual participants in the lead roles! Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos and Spencer Stone star as themselves - the three young men who fought back against a terrorist on the train of the movie's title in 2015. As we see bits and pieces of the lead-up to the attack and its early moments, the plot really centers around these three guys and their friendship, as it develops from middle school into adulthood. Stone and Skarlatos fulfill their life-long interest in the military by enlisting (Stone in the Air Force and Skarlatos in the Army National Guard), while Sadler was still living back home in Sacramento, trying to decide what to do with his life. Although they were on three different continents at the time, the three old friends decide to get together for a trip through Europe. Sadler and Stone meet up in Italy to begin their travels while Skarlatos visits an old friend in Germany. That's where the three guys link up to continue their European tour as a group. After partying a bit too hard in Amsterdam, they board that train to Paris for, as the film portrays it, their date with destiny... followed by international recognition and lives forever changed. ""The 15:17 to Paris"" is written by screenwriter Dorothy Blyskal, adapting the book by Sadler, Skarlatos, and Stone (and Jeffrey E. Stern, another participant in the incident) and is helmed by Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood. The decision to have the actual heroes play themselves in their story is a noble one and it pays off, as all three young men do a very good job, especially for three guys with no prior acting experience whatsoever (but who now all have agents and have decided to pursue careers in acting). Less wise was the decision to give most of the adult speaking roles to actors primarily known for film and/or TV comedies. (It was distracting and, as a group, they weren't very good.) The kids playing the heroes as kids also could have been better cast - and their dialog definitely could have been better written. The script also awkwardly goes out of its way to impart religious significance to the film's events. In spite of all this, the lives of these three young men are portrayed well and realistically (especially the two who served in the military), the movie is well edited and the terrorist attack and its aftermath is both exciting and interesting to watch as it plays out. This film represents a noble effort, it tells an inspiring story and it's entertaining, but it could have and should have been better than it is. ""B"""
10.0 / 10,15:17 to Paris is a real film for real families!,tnduckhead,12 February 2018,"It was refreshing to see a movie that the entire family could watch and enjoy together. The 15:17 to Paris was intelligent, well put together and extremely relevant to today's world. We were impressed with Mr. Eastwood's audacity in not going with typical Hollywood""stars"" and used the real men to reenact their situation. That was the reason I wanted to see it. I had been told the reviews were not that good - which is a shame. Most critics do not want to see anything that reflects a human being that believes in God. Mr. Eastwood is still at the top of the game in actually producing films that the movie-going public enjoys. We thank him and hope he has a great time at Pebble Beach this week."
8.0 / 10,Great Film overall,mitcherator777,11 February 2018,"All Aboard!
Great film overall, I enjoyed how the movie developed. There were a few things that could have been improved in the movie, but overall I thought it was a great movie.
The 15:17 to Paris was overall a good movie, from beginning to end. 
The Story starts out slow but picks up at a fast moving pace. I will let your imagination run wild from there and you'll have to see it for yourself.."
8.0 / 10,"Good film but, takes a while to pick up the pace.",Anurag-Shetty,10 February 2018,"The 15:17 to Paris tells the true story of Spencer(Spencer Stone), Alek(Alek Skarlatos) & Anthony(Anthony Sadler). While holidaying in Europe, Spencer, Alek & Anthony take a train bound for Paris. They realize that, there is a terrorist threat to the train. The 15:17 to Paris is a great film. However, director Clint Eastwood loses the purpose of the whole movie, about halfway through. The scenes featuring Spencer, Alek & Anthony in their youth, are endearing & essential to the plot. What comes after, right up to the climactic scene, is inconsequential to the overall film. The climax is thrilling & is the highlight of the movie. Casting the real-life heroes to play their onscreen counterparts, is an innovative choice. Alek Skarlatos is superb as Alek. Anthony Sadler is excellent as Anthony. Spencer Stone is brilliant as Spencer. Judy Greer & Jenna Fischer are spectacular as Joyce & Heidi, respectively. William Jennings, Bryce Gheisar & Paul-Mikel Williams are adorable as Spencer(11-14), Alek(11-14) & Anthony(11-14), respectively. The 15:17 to Paris is not a must watch. However, it is worth a watch, to witness the courage of Spencer, Alek & Anthony. This movie will make you believe that, kindness & selflessness still exist."
,Polarized Opinions,C N,19 February 2018,"I plan to see the movie tomorrow, but reading the user reviews reminds me of our current political climate...a polarized nation. It seems people either loved or hated this film. This film is not a phony, bombastic Hollywood action thriller, it's real life. Real life isn't filled with non-stop action, constant intrigue and perpetual interest.
I'm considering that Eastwood found this story compelling from the standpoint of contrast. To live a terrorist event would certainly disrupt most people's mundane life. Put yourself in the shoes of the heroes. Imagine being on vacation somewhere enjoying yourself then being suddenly thrown into a life-or-death situation. That's what I plan to do. The mundane makes the event more intense."

10.0 / 10,Real Heroes not just wannabes in Lycra,roweaton,21 February 2018,"I've just seen Clint Eastwood's latest film offering 'The 15:17 To Paris', that depicts the thwarted terrorist attack on a train which was headed to Paris on August 21, 2015. The leads are played by the actual 3 American heroes (and also close childhood friends) which makes this offering a little wooden and documentary styled but still compelling.I can't help but wonder why people are flocking to see Marvels fictitious Black Panther when they have 3 real heroes (one an African American) to honour instead.It's people like Anthony Sadler, Alex Skarlatos and Spencer Stone that truly deserve attention, and not a bunch of Lycra wearing wannabes with a politically charged merchandise opportunity."
8.0 / 10,The experiment was a success,Mouravi2000,19 February 2018,"Young people across the world now lives in Instagram and selfie-sticks. Girls, Coca-Cola, boredom, all don't care. I think this film criticize those who are jealous of the three guys. Three guys - the same as all-could do what young people usually can't. They're not cowards, though not actors. But they suddenly took off in a movie! ""What an injustice!"". And you, critics, for that in movies sack? What can you do?"
